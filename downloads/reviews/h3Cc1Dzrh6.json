        "value": "Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most common subtype of renal cancer, yet the discovery of robust prognostic biomarkers has been hindered by its profound molecular heterogeneity, complex tumor microenvironment, and metabolic rewiring. Here, we present an integrative transcriptomic analysis of 314 KIRC patients to uncover molecular subtypes and biomarker signatures with clinical relevance. Using an iterative survival-guided feature selection approach, we refined 1,000 highly variable genes into a compact 76-gene signature that enabled unsupervised clustering into two prognostically distinct subgroups. Patients in the high-risk subgroup exhibited significantly poorer overall survival (log-rank p = $4.5 \\times 10^{-4}$) and elevated event rates compared to the low-risk group. Differential expression analysis revealed 2,927 subtype-specific genes, of which 70\\% demonstrated significant associations with survival in univariate Cox regression. Functional enrichment highlighted convergence on cancer-associated pathways, including TOR signaling, regulation of macroautophagy, and negative regulation of catabolic processes, implicating both canonical oncogenic drivers (e.g., PIK3CA, EIF4EBP2, PRKAA2) and modulators of cellular homeostasis (e.g., UBR1, MTM1). Together, these findings establish a refined prognostic biomarker framework for KIRC, define clinically relevant molecular subtypes, and reveal pathway-level vulnerabilities that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention."

        "value": "This paper presents a technically competent transcriptomic analysis of KIRC, using established bioinformatics methods such as survival-guided feature selection, K-means clustering, and pathway enrichment. The workflow is clear and the results are systematically described. However, there are significant concerns: the clustering produced highly imbalanced groups, there is no validation in independent cohorts, and key methodological details (e.g., multiple testing correction, clustering parameters) are missing. The biological findings (TOR signaling, autophagy) are not novel, and the 76-gene signature is likely too large for clinical use. The paper does not compare its results to existing KIRC classifications or prognostic tools, and the lack of validation undermines the clinical relevance. While the combination of methods shows some novelty, the overall approach and findings are incremental. The authors claim to provide code and data, but insufficient methodological detail limits reproducibility. Major concerns include lack of validation, imbalanced clustering, limited novelty, questionable clinical translatability, and missing comparisons to existing approaches. AI involvement is properly disclosed but may limit biological insight. Overall, the work is competent but does not meet the standards for a top-tier venue due to these limitations."

There are also major issues with clarity, such as inconsistent reporting of results, poor figure quality, and missing methodological details. The study's findings are largely confirmatory rather than novel, and there is no comparison to existing classification systems. The lack of methodological transparency makes the work irreproducible.

The main issues include circularity and overfitting due to lack of proper validation (no internal or external validation, no multivariable adjustment for clinical covariates), internal inconsistencies in reported cluster sizes, and misinterpretation of pathway enrichment significance (incorrect claims of significance despite high FDR-adjusted p-values). Methodological details are insufficient for replication, and there is no benchmarking against established KIRC subtyping literature. Figures are appropriate but lack quantitative rigor and statistical context. The workflow is standard and lacks originality beyond the specific 76-gene set, which itself is not externally validated. Reproducibility is poor due to missing code/data links and incomplete methods. The paper's conclusions are undermined by these flaws, and the recommendation is rejection in its current form. Substantial re-analysis, correction of inconsistencies, rigorous validation, and transparent reporting are required for the work to be considered further."
