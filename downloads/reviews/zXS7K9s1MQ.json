        "value": "This paper investigates the hypothesis that cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH) play a pivotal role in mediating matter-to-dark energy conversion, and examines the consequential impact of this process on resolving the persistent Hubble tension. Drawing upon data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, complemented by cosmic microwave background (CMB) datasets, we perform a rigorous analysis of a physical model. In this model, the production of dark energy is intrinsically linked to the cosmic star formation rate density, thereby establishing a direct relationship between astrophysical processes and cosmological dynamics. The findings emanating from this analysis suggest that the CCBH model demonstrates a compelling alignment with the observed cosmological expansion history. Furthermore, this framework offers a potential pathway to mitigate the existing tension with the local distance ladder measurements, a discrepancy that has been a subject of intense scrutiny in recent years. The implications of this model extend to the realm of neutrino physics, as our results indicate that the CCBH-mediated dark energy production could exert a discernible influence on the constraints derived for neutrino mass estimations. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole physics, dark energy, and the evolving structure of the cosmos."

        "value": "This paper addresses important questions in cosmology and proposes an intriguing model, but it is fundamentally flawed. The manuscript lacks any quantitative results, figures, tables, or statistical analysis to support its claims. The \"Results\" section is purely descriptive, and the methodology appears not to have been executed. The inclusion of irrelevant and nonsensical citations further undermines its credibility and suggests a lack of scholarly rigor. While the writing is clear and the structure logical, this clarity is superficial and misleading, as the paper presents unsupported claims as established facts. The significance of the problems addressed is high, but the paper offers no evidence or valid analysis, resulting in no scientific contribution. The originality is limited, as the core concept is not new and the promised novel analysis is absent. The work is entirely irreproducible, and the ethical standards are compromised by misleading citations and failure to disclose the absence of analysis. In conclusion, the manuscript is unverifiable, irreproducible, and lacks the essential components of scientific research. It should be rejected in the strongest possible terms."

        "value": "This paper investigates cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH) as a mechanism for dark energy production and their potential to resolve the Hubble tension. While the topic is relevant and timely, the paper suffers from several significant issues that prevent it from meeting the standards expected for a top-tier venue.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe paper presents a theoretical framework linking black hole mass evolution to cosmological expansion, but lacks the mathematical rigor expected for such claims. The core theoretical mechanism—how black holes couple to cosmological expansion and convert matter to dark energy—is not adequately developed. The paper references the quasi-local Misner-Sharp mass formalism but doesn't provide the detailed mathematical framework showing how this leads to the proposed coupling. The connection between cosmic star formation rate density and dark energy production is asserted rather than derived from first principles.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is reasonably well-organized but suffers from unclear explanations of key concepts. The transition from theoretical background to the specific CCBH model is abrupt, and the mathematical formulation is incomplete. Critical parameters like the cosmological coupling constant κ are introduced without sufficient mathematical context. The writing style varies inconsistently throughout, suggesting possible AI generation issues.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nWhile addressing the Hubble tension is important, the paper's approach is not sufficiently novel. The concept of cosmologically-coupled objects has been explored before, and the paper doesn't clearly differentiate its contributions from existing work. The claimed resolution of the Hubble tension is not convincingly demonstrated through rigorous analysis.\n\nExperimental/Observational Analysis:\nThe paper claims to use DESI Data Release 2 but acknowledges that \"full DR2 data is not yet available in the literature\" and instead uses DR1 data as a \"proxy.\" This is problematic for a paper making specific claims about DESI DR2 constraints. The statistical analysis methodology is incompletely described, making it difficult to assess the validity of the claimed Hubble tension reduction.\n\nReproducibility Concerns:\nThe paper lacks sufficient detail for reproduction. The statistical framework using MCMC is mentioned but not adequately described. Model parameters and their priors are not clearly specified. The connection between theory and observational constraints is not rigorously established.\n\nMajor Issues:\n1. Incomplete theoretical development: The fundamental mechanism is not rigorously derived\n2. Data availability problems: Claims about DESI DR2 when using DR1 data\n3. Lack of quantitative results: No specific numerical constraints or error bars on key parameters\n4. Insufficient comparison with alternatives: Other Hubble tension solutions are mentioned but not rigorously compared\n5. Missing crucial details: Statistical methodology, model parameters, and observational fitting procedures are inadequately described\n\nMinor Issues:\n- References include irrelevant citations (e.g., medical studies, animal models)\n- Some sections appear to be AI-generated without proper integration\n- Inconsistent notation and terminology usage\n\nEthical Concerns:\nThe authors' checklist indicates heavy AI involvement (marked as [D] for most categories), which raises questions about the originality and depth of the scientific contribution. While AI assistance is permitted, the level of AI involvement here may compromise the intellectual contribution expected from human researchers.\n\nRecommendation:\nThis paper addresses an important problem but falls short of the scientific rigor and completeness required for acceptance at a premier venue. The theoretical framework needs substantial development, the observational analysis requires access to actual DR2 data and proper statistical methodology, and the overall presentation needs significant improvement."

        "value": "The paper proposes a novel mechanism involving cosmologically coupled black holes (CCBHs) converting matter into dark energy, linked to the cosmic star-formation rate density (SFRD), and claims this alleviates the Hubble tension and impacts neutrino mass constraints. However, the manuscript lacks quantitative results, explicit model equations, and reproducible analysis details. The Results section makes strong claims without providing numerical constraints, parameter posteriors, goodness-of-fit metrics, or supporting figures/tables. The model is not fully specified, with missing governing equations and mappings. Data and likelihood details are absent, and the statistical analysis remains vague. There are internal inconsistencies (e.g., misalignment of SFRD and acceleration epochs), questionable assertions, and scope drift with irrelevant content and references, some of which appear error-prone or out of scope. The paper lacks essential elements of a quantitative cosmology paper, such as explicit equations, parameter definitions, and data-vector construction. While the topic could be significant if rigorously analyzed, the manuscript does not establish novelty or provide new constraints. Reproducibility is not feasible due to missing details. Ethical concerns are minimal, but the limitations discussion is unfocused. The literature review is incomplete and lacks critical engagement with competing models. Actionable recommendations include fully specifying the model, building a reproducible inference pipeline, presenting quantitative results, checking complementary constraints, tightening the manuscript, and sharing resources. The verdict is that the submission is far from the standard required for acceptance and requires a complete reworking with rigorous, transparent, and quantitative analysis."
