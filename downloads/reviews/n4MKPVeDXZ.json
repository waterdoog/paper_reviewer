(1) crop vs. stated resize; Eq. (9) uses undefined fk,i and discrepancies with Algorithm 1's Vtrue; BCE-with-logits vs. BCELoss ambiguity.\n- Reporting Node Accuracy for some baselines that do not have node prediction heads is inconsistent and unexplained."

        "value": "This paper introduces a Multimodal Clinical Integration Transformer (MCIT), a novel deep learning architecture for the automated generation of veterinary radiology reports. The primary challenge addressed is the subjective and time-consuming nature of manual report generation for conditions like canine cardiomegaly. The MCIT model introduces two key innovations: 1) It is multimodal, processing both radiographic images and structured clinical history to provide more context-aware diagnostics. 2) It integrates predicted clinical findings directly into the multimodal context, allowing the model to ground report generation in specific abnormalities. The MCIT model is trained and evaluated on a local dataset of 5,000 canine chest X-rays and corresponding reports. Our MCIT model demonstrates strong performance, with a BLEU-4 score of 0.510 and a Clinical F1 score of 0.920, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of veterinary diagnostics."

        "value": "This paper presents a Multimodal Clinical Integration Transformer (MCIT) for automated veterinary radiology report generation. The architecture is well-designed, integrating image and clinical data, with the key innovation being the explicit integration of predicted clinical findings into the multimodal context. The experimental setup is reasonable, with appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. The paper is well-written, organized, and provides clear explanations and comprehensive implementation details. The work addresses a significant problem in veterinary medicine, showing strong clinical relevance with high Clinical F1 and Node Accuracy scores. The approach is original, and the related work section is comprehensive. Ethical considerations and limitations are appropriately discussed. However, concerns include simulated baselines, lack of statistical significance testing, a relatively small dataset, CPU-only training, and reliance on predefined entity extraction for clinical evaluation. Strengths include the novel integration approach, comprehensive evaluation, strong ablation studies, practical relevance, and thorough methodology. Overall, this is a solid technical contribution with clear practical value, despite some evaluation limitations."

The main contribution is a Clinical Finding Integration module that grounds report generation in predicted clinical findings. The paper is well-motivated and the architectural idea is interesting, with ablation studies supporting the importance of the proposed components. However, the experimental validation is fundamentally flawed: baseline comparisons are invalid as they are 'simulated' rather than rigorously implemented, the image encoder is described in a way that undermines credibility, and results lack statistical significance. Clarity is generally good, but crucial details about the model and input data are missing. The work is potentially significant and original, but reproducibility is severely limited due to proprietary data and ambiguous descriptions. Overall, the paper's claims are unsubstantiated due to the flawed evaluation, and I recommend rejection."

The reported results are high, but the evaluation is fundamentally undermined by the use of simulated baselines, lack of real comparative experiments, and insufficient methodological detail. Major concerns include: (1) lack of credible evaluation due to simulated baselines and no external replication possible; (2) insufficient detail on label extraction, clinical history vector, and architecture; (3) risk of shortcut learning due to template-based dataset and lack of control experiments; (4) incremental novelty and incomplete literature positioning; (5) inadequate reproducibility and openness. Minor issues include typos, unclear hyperparameters, and missing decoding details. The paper addresses an important application and is generally readable, but the methodological and evaluation shortcomings make the claims and conclusions not credible for acceptance. Actionable recommendations are provided, but as it stands, the paper cannot be recommended for acceptance."
