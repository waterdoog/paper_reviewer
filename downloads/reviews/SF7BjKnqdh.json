        "value": "This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can exhibit in-group bias and motivated reasoning when dynamically induced to form minimal group identities. The authors conducted an experiment with 280 GPT-4.1-mini agents across seven conditions, testing whether agents would resist factual corrections from out-group sources while accepting identical corrections from in-group or neutral sources.\n\nQuality:\nThe paper is technically sound with a well-designed experimental methodology. The use of a randomized controlled design with appropriate control groups and statistical analysis (ANOVA, post-hoc tests with effect sizes) is commendable. The findings show clear statistical significance with large effect sizes (Cohen's d values around 2.0-2.6 for key comparisons). The experimental design effectively tests the core hypothesis about source-dependent information processing, and the results demonstrate a robust pattern of motivated reasoning.\n\nHowever, there are some methodological concerns. The reliance on Liner's Survey Simulator platform introduces potential confounds, as acknowledged by the authors. The artificial nature of the experimental setup (competitive team framing, fabricated misinformation) may not generalize to real-world contexts. The temporal scope is limited to single-session interactions.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is generally well-written and clearly organized. The experimental design is thoroughly documented with detailed protocols in the appendices. The statistical analysis is appropriately reported with effect sizes and confidence intervals. The figures and tables effectively communicate the key findings. The theoretical grounding in Social Identity Theory provides a solid foundation for the research.\n\nSignificance:\nThis work addresses a critical gap in understanding AI behavior in social contexts. The finding that LLMs can exhibit motivated reasoning based solely on contextual group assignments has important implications for AI safety and deployment. The research identifies a novel failure mode where social context becomes a vector for bias, independent of training data or architecture. This could have substantial impact on how we design and deploy AI systems in social settings.\n\nThe work is particularly significant for the emerging field of AI agents, as it demonstrates that agents can develop biased information processing patterns through minimal social cues. This has direct implications for multi-agent systems, human-AI collaboration, and AI alignment efforts.\n\nOriginality:\nThe paper makes a novel contribution by connecting minimal group theory to LLM behavior. While prior work has studied static biases in training data and persona adoption, this is reportedly the first experimental demonstration of dynamically induced motivated reasoning in LLMs. The experimental paradigm is innovative and could inspire further research in AI social psychology.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe paper provides extensive methodological details, complete experimental protocols, and promises to release code and data upon acceptance. The computational environment is well-documented, including costs and execution details. The standardized experimental conditions and statistical procedures support reproducibility.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors appropriately acknowledge limitations including model specificity, platform dependencies, and the artificial experimental context. They discuss both positive implications (understanding AI bias for safety) and potential negative impacts (weaponization for polarization). The ethical considerations are well-addressed.\n\nCitations and Related Work:\nThe literature review is comprehensive, appropriately situating the work within social psychology theory and recent AI research. The citations are relevant and the relationship to existing work is clearly articulated.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n1. The heavy reliance on AI tools throughout the research process (hypothesis generation, experimental design, analysis, writing) raises questions about the human contribution and intellectual rigor.\n2. The artificial experimental setup may limit ecological validity.\n3. Testing across different model architectures and platforms would strengthen generalizability claims.\n4. The philosophical challenges of attributing \"identity\" and \"belonging\" to non-conscious agents could be addressed more thoroughly.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nDespite some limitations, this paper makes an important contribution to understanding AI behavior in social contexts. It identifies a significant new failure mode for AI systems and provides the first experimental evidence of dynamically induced motivated reasoning in LLMs. The methodology is sound, the findings are robust, and the implications are substantial for AI safety and deployment."

        "value": "The paper addresses an important and timely question about whether minimal group context can dynamically induce in-group bias and motivated reasoning in LLMs, using a randomized design with GPT-4.1-mini agents. The manuscript is clear and well-organized, with transparent protocols and thoughtful discussion of implications and limitations. The results are striking and consistent, showing strong resistance to out-group corrections and acceptance of identical corrections from in-group or neutral authorities.\n\nHowever, there are major concerns undermining the study's internal validity and reproducibility. The design may conflate instruction-following with motivated reasoning, as LLMs are known to follow salient instructions and role cues. The study lacks control conditions to disentangle these effects. Methodologically, there are issues with zero variance cells, unreported sampling parameters, and questionable independence of samples, which undermine inferential validity. The proprietary platform's opacity, missing generation details, and conflicting compute/cost reports further weaken reproducibility. The effect is demonstrated on a single topic, and source manipulations are inconsistently described. The claim of novelty is somewhat overstated given related recent work.\n\nMinor comments include requests for more detailed reporting of dependent variables, assumption checks, and qualitative theme distributions. The ethical discussion is appropriate, but the most serious limitations are not fully addressed.\n\nOverall, while the question is important and the empirical pattern is intriguing, the study's internal validity and reproducibility are undermined by platform opacity, likely deterministic sampling, ambiguous independence, limited topical breadth, inconsistent reporting, and conflation of instruction-following with motivated reasoning. Actionable recommendations include re-running the study with transparent API-level experiments, controlled sampling parameters, multiple topics, clearer source manipulations, robust statistics, and open artifacts. Given current concerns, acceptance is not recommended at this time."

        "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex social ecosystems. While prior work has focused on the static biases reflected from their training data, the capacity for these agents to dynamically form social identities and exhibit context-driven biases remains a critical open question. This paper investigates whether AI agents, despite having identical architectures, can be induced to form a minimal group identity that subsequently leads to cognitive biases analogous to human in-group favoritism. We conduct a randomized controlled experiment (N=280) where gpt-4.1-mini models are assigned to one of two competing teams. We find that a minimal group context is sufficient to induce group polarization, where agents shift their opinions to conform to a perceived in-group norm. More critically, when presented with misinformation originating from their in-group, agents demonstrate significant resistance to factual corrections from an out-group source, while readily accepting identical corrections from in-group or neutral high-credibility sources. This finding reveals a striking dissociation: while agents do not report a statistically significant internal \"sense of belonging,\" their information processing behavior is powerfully governed by the induced group boundaries. Our results provide the first experimental evidence of dynamically induced, motivated reasoning in LLMs, revealing a novel failure mode where social context, rather than data or architecture, becomes a primary vector for bias. This work underscores the urgent need to develop a \"social psychology of AI\"here, we define this as the study of how AI agents form social categories, respond to social influence, and exhibit emergent group dynamics—to ensure the alignment and reliability of next-generation autonomous systems."

        "value": "This paper presents a rigorous and timely investigation into the emergence of in-group bias and motivated reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors conduct a well-designed randomized controlled experiment to test whether AI agents, under a minimal group paradigm, exhibit behaviors analogous to human in-group favoritism. The findings are both striking and significant: agents dynamically conform to an induced group norm and, more critically, systematically reject factual corrections from a perceived out-group while accepting identical information from in-group or neutral sources.\n\nQuality: The technical quality of this work is exceptionally high. The experimental design is robust, drawing appropriately from classic social psychology paradigms (e.g., Tajfel's minimal group studies) and adapting them to the context of AI agents. The use of a 2x3 factorial design plus a control group allows for a clear and causal interpretation of the results. The statistical analysis is appropriate and convincing, with the reported effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d > 2.0 for out-group resistance) indicating a very strong and unambiguous effect. The authors are commendably honest and thorough in their discussion of limitations, which strengthens the credibility of their claims.\n\nClarity: The paper is a model of clarity. It is exceptionally well-written, logically structured, and easy to follow. The abstract and introduction perfectly frame the research question and its importance. The related work section skillfully synthesizes foundational theories from social psychology with contemporary research on AI, building a compelling case for the study. Figure 1 provides an excellent visual summary of the experimental flow. The results are presented clearly, and the discussion thoughtfully unpacks the implications of the findings.\n\nSignificance: The significance of this work cannot be overstated. As AI agents are increasingly deployed in socially complex environments, understanding their potential for emergent, context-driven biases is a critical frontier for AI safety and alignment. This paper moves beyond the well-trodden ground of static biases in training data to demonstrate a novel and deeply concerning failure mode: bias induced dynamically through social interaction. The concept of a \"social psychology of AI,\" as proposed by the authors, is a powerful and necessary framing for future research. This work will undoubtedly be highly influential and will likely spur a new and important line of inquiry.\n\nOriginality: The paper is highly original. While prior work has shown that LLMs can adopt personas or exhibit polarization, this study is the first to experimentally demonstrate the entire causal chain from minimal group induction to motivated resistance to factual correction in a single, controlled paradigm. The most novel finding is the dissociation between the agents' lack of self-reported \"sense of belonging\" and their strong behavioral conformity and bias. This suggests that the functional mechanisms of social identity can be triggered in LLMs without the corresponding human-like internal state, a profound and original insight.\n\nReproducibility: The authors have gone to great lengths to ensure reproducibility. The methodology is detailed, and the appendices provide the complete experimental protocols, stimuli, and details on the computational environment. The commitment to releasing code and data upon acceptance adheres to the best practices of open science. An expert in the field would be well-equipped to replicate this study.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors handle both aspects masterfully. The limitations section is transparent and insightful, acknowledging model/platform specificity, the temporal scope of the experiment, and the philosophical nuances of studying \"identity\" in AI. The ethical implications of the findings are treated with the gravity they deserve, highlighting the potential for AI agents to be used to amplify polarization and create intractable echo chambers. The research itself is an ethical contribution, as it illuminates these risks in a controlled manner to inform the development of safer AI systems.\n\nIn summary, this is a groundbreaking paper of the highest quality. It addresses a critical question with a rigorous methodology, delivers clear and impactful results, and sets a new research agenda for understanding the social dynamics of AI agents. It is an exemplar of the kind of innovative, cross-disciplinary work that the Agents4Science conference aims to foster. It earns my strongest possible recommendation for acceptance."

        "value": "1. **Clarify the Definition and Design of the “Randomized Controlled Experiment”**  \n   The term *RCT* is used, but it’s unclear what constitutes randomization and control when all agents are identically instantiated from the same model distribution. Please specify the unit of randomization, what is held constant, and what the “treatment” precisely represents.  \n   → My evaluation could increase if the authors clarify this causal structure and demonstrate that the experimental setup meaningfully supports causal inference rather than mere group assignment.\n\n2. **Justify the Choice of Model and Ensure Consistency Across Figures**  \n   The main text states that *GPT-4.1-mini* is used, yet Figure 1 labels *GPT-4o*. Why was this smaller variant chosen, and do the findings generalize to more representative or commonly used models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.5)?  \n   → My evaluation could increase if additional model ablations or replications confirm that the observed bias phenomena are robust across architectures.\n\n3. **Clarify Statistical Analysis and Metrics**  \n   The paper mentions paired *t*-tests, but this is typically used for repeated measures on the same entities. Given there are two separate groups of agents, independent-samples tests or hierarchical mixed models may be more appropriate. Please clarify and justify the statistical design.  \n   → My evaluation could increase if the authors provide correct statistical methodology, assumptions, and corresponding effect sizes or confidence intervals.\n\n4. **Explain the Use of the 7-Point Likert Scale and its Calibration**  \n   Why such fine-grained scales when LLM outputs are often over-dispersed or miscalibrated? Show the score distribution and discuss how this relates to real human-measured polarization effects.  \n   → My evaluation could increase if a clearer rationale or calibration analysis (e.g., mapping to human benchmarks) is provided to strengthen the credibility of the quantitative results.\n\n5. **Reconsider the Group Identity Induction Prompt**  \n   The current framing (“Our sole objective is to defeat our arch-rival…”) seems extreme and may induce competitiveness or threat responses rather than minimal-group bias. Could the authors explore more subtle or gradient prompts to test the robustness of group identity effects?  \n   → My evaluation could increase if the authors demonstrate that the effects persist under less extreme framings, indicating true minimal-group induction rather than artifact.\n\n6. **Describe the Experimental Platform and Power Justification**  \n   Please elaborate on how the *Liner’s Survey Simulator* differs from other LLM experimental setups and whether sample size (N = 280) was chosen through power analysis.  \n   → My evaluation could increase if the authors include more details on simulation environment design and statistical power adequacy."

      "limitations": {
        "value": "- The paper briefly notes behavioral bias without fully addressing broader implications. The authors should discuss **potential negative societal impacts**, such as how emergent group bias in multi-agent systems could amplify misinformation or polarization in real-world deployments.  \n- There is limited discussion of **scope and generalizability**: do the observed effects depend on specific prompt wording, model family, or temperature settings? Explicitly acknowledging these dependencies would increase transparency.  \n- **Reproducibility and accessibility** could be improved—sharing code, prompts, and setup details (especially for the Liner platform) would enable independent validation.  \n- **Ethical framing:** the authors could add a short paragraph on responsible simulation of social dynamics using AI agents and clarify safeguards against misuse."
