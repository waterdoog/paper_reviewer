        "value": "The paper addresses an important benchmarking task (Humanity's Last Exam) and demonstrates a systematic approach to model evaluation and aggregation. The methodology using Best-of-N rejection sampling is sound, and the authors test 17 different LLMs with 9 aggregation methods across 8 question categories. The experimental design is reasonable, with human verification on a random sample of 100 questions. However, there are some technical concerns: the 53% accuracy claim needs more rigorous statistical validation, the Best-of-N approach is computationally expensive, and the paper lacks deeper analysis of model performance by category. The paper is generally well-written and organized, with effective figures and tables, but some technical details (such as the human verification protocol and model selection criteria) could be clearer. The work has moderate significance for the AI evaluation community, with a novel educational video generation component, but the benchmark's recent release limits historical context, and improvements are mainly due to computational scaling. Methodological novelty is limited, with contributions being systematic application to a new benchmark, model similarity analysis, and an educational video pipeline. Reproducibility is good, with promises to release code and data. Ethics and limitations are adequately addressed, and related work is comprehensively cited. Major issues include questionable statistical significance of the main claim, high computational cost, and insufficiently addressed benchmark contamination concerns. Minor issues include figure readability, rigor of mathematical formulations, and the connection of the video component to the main contribution. Overall, the paper is solid empirical work with systematic evaluation, but the contributions are incremental, and the high computational cost and limited statistical validation are concerning. The work provides value but falls short of top-tier standards."

        "value": "This paper presents a pipeline that combines Best-of-N (N=8) rejection sampling with category-specific model selection to tackle Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), reporting 53% accuracy on a 100-question sample without online search, at ~$3 and under 5 minutes per question. The work evaluates 17 LLMs and 9 aggregation methods, analyzes model similarities in errors, and generates Manim-based educational videos with an AI narrator. An expert mathematician curates hard math problems and discusses LLM limitations.\n\nStrengths include a clearly described engineering pipeline, informative systematic comparisons across models and time, and a descriptive analysis of model agreement and error patterns. However, the central claim that “AI passes HLE” is not justified: evaluation is on a small, random sample with no formal passing criterion, and per-category sample sizes are too small for reliable conclusions. Statistical rigor is lacking (no confidence intervals, multiple samples, or significance tests), and the ablation over aggregation methods is only qualitative. The LLM-as-judge component is unvalidated, and cost claims lack detailed breakdowns. Critical details for reproducibility (prompts, judge criteria, hyperparameters, seeds) are missing, and proprietary models further complicate reproduction. Ethical risks around face/voice cloning are acknowledged but not thoroughly addressed.\n\nThe method is not novel, and improvements over zero-shot are unsurprising. The model similarity analysis is interesting but limited by small samples. The work’s impact is modest without stronger evidence or comparison to SOTA. Code and data are promised but not provided, and reproducibility is insufficient.\n\nKey concerns include the need for full-benchmark evaluation, rigorous ablation, clear passing criteria, detailed reporting for reproducibility, and stronger ethical treatment of face/voice cloning. A user study for the educational videos is also suggested.\n\nIn summary, despite a clear write-up and useful measurements, the work lacks methodological novelty, sufficient empirical evidence, statistical rigor, and reproducibility. Rejection is recommended, with suggestions for a stronger revision."

        "value": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the \"Humanity's Last Exam\" (HLE) benchmark, demonstrating that a combination of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced inference-time techniques can achieve a 53% accuracy score. The authors' methodology involves a rigorous evaluation of 17 LLMs, a selection of the best zero-shot models, and the application of Best-of-N (BoN) rejection sampling combined with a domain-specific model routing strategy. Beyond achieving a new state-of-the-art on this challenging benchmark, the paper makes several other valuable contributions, including an in-depth analysis of model error correlations, the generation of educational video tutorials for math problems, and an expert-curated analysis of the problems that still elude current AI capabilities.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe paper is of exceptional quality. The experimental methodology is sound, systematic, and thoroughly executed. The ablation studies, starting from zero-shot performance and incrementally adding BoN sampling and model routing, clearly and convincingly justify the final approach. The claims are well-supported by the extensive results presented in numerous tables and figures. The inclusion of human verification for a sample of questions adds a layer of confidence to the reported accuracy. The authors are commendably transparent about the limitations of their work, such as the diminishing returns of sampling with imperfect verifiers and the static nature of the HLE benchmark. The analysis of unsolved hard math problems is a particularly strong feature, providing a clear-eyed view of current SOTA limitations and outlining concrete directions for future research. This demonstrates a high degree of scientific maturity.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written and organized. The narrative is clear and easy to follow. The abstract and introduction effectively set the context and summarize the contributions. Figures and tables are well-designed, clearly labeled, and effectively communicate complex results. Figure 1, in particular, provides an excellent high-level overview of the entire research pipeline, from question answering to video generation. The paper provides sufficient detail for the work to be understood, and the methods are described with enough clarity that an expert could attempt to replicate the setup.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThe work is highly significant. Establishing a strong baseline of 53% on a new, diverse, and challenging benchmark is a major contribution in itself. This result will likely serve as a key reference point for future research on advanced AI reasoning. The paper's impact extends beyond this single number. The detailed analysis of trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost is of great practical value to the community. The analysis of shared errors between models provides valuable insights for developing more robust ensemble methods. Furthermore, the innovative use of AI to generate educational video tutorials is a compelling demonstration of how these technologies can be used to create tangible educational value, moving beyond pure benchmark performance.\n\nOriginality and Novelty:\nWhile the core techniques used (Best-of-N sampling, model routing) are not new, the paper's originality lies in several areas:\n1.  The sheer scale and systematic nature of their application to a novel and complex problem.\n2.  The combination of multiple analyses (performance, cost, error correlation) into a single, cohesive study.\n3.  The novel and creative extension of the work to generate multimodal educational content (the Manim videos with an AI narrator). This is a standout feature that significantly elevates the paper's contribution.\n4.  The forward-looking analysis of remaining hard problems, which frames the next set of challenges for the field.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors provide a wealth of information about their experimental setup, including the models, methods (BoN with N=8), and frameworks (OptiLLM) used. They are transparent about their evaluation protocol and promise to release code and data upon publication. The primary barrier to reproduction will be the significant computational cost (~$3 per question), which may be prohibitive for some research groups. However, the paper is reproducible in principle, and the authors have done their part to ensure transparency.\n\nMinor Weaknesses and Suggestions:\n- The title, \"AI Passes Humanity's Last Exam,\" is sensationalist. A 53% score is not typically considered a \"pass.\" While this is a significant achievement in the context of AI benchmarks, a more measured title would better reflect the scientific tone of the work. I suggest the authors consider a title that, while still impactful, is less hyperbolic (e.g., \"Achieving 53% on Humanity's Last Exam with Advanced AI Agents\").\n- The paper mentions that model hyperparameters are \"set to defaults.\" It would be slightly more rigorous to specify what these defaults are, especially for key sampling parameters like temperature, as they can significantly influence the diversity and quality of generated samples in a BoN setup.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is an outstanding paper that represents a landmark achievement in the evaluation and application of advanced AI systems. It is technically deep, methodologically rigorous, and highly impactful. The work is not only a benchmark paper but a multifaceted research contribution that includes insightful analysis, a novel creative application, and a thoughtful discussion of future challenges. It sets a very high standard for work in this area and is a perfect fit for the Agents4Science conference. I recommend it for acceptance without hesitation."
