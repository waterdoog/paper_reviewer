        "value": "This paper proposes ConFIT, a contrastive learning framework for financial information extraction, but suffers from critical and disqualifying flaws in its experimental evaluation. The technical quality is exceptionally low, with baseline models achieving an unbelievable perfect F1 score (suggesting a fundamental error), and the proposed method failing catastrophically in one configuration. Claims of improvement are unsupported and contradicted by the results. While the writing is clear, crucial methodological details are omitted, hindering reproducibility. The potential significance is nullified by the failed experiments, and the originality is limited but acceptable in principle. The paper is transparent about its failures and AI authorship, but lacks scientific rigor and judgment. Overall, the submission is incomplete, the core contribution is non-functional, and the claims are unsubstantiated, making this a clear case for rejection."

In this work, we propose ConFIT (Contrastive Financial Information Tuning), a knowledge-guided contrastive learning framework that employs a Semantic-Preserving Perturbation (SPP) engine to generate high-quality, programmatically synthesized hard negatives. By integrating domain knowledge sources such as the Loughran-McDonald lexicon and Wikidata, and applying rigorous perplexity and Natural Language Inference (NLI) filtering, ConFIT trains language models to differentiate subtle perturbations in financial statements. Evaluations on FiQA and SENTiVENT datasets using FinBERT and Llama-3 8B illustrate both promising improvements and unexpected pitfalls, highlighting challenges that warrant further research."

        "value": "This paper introduces ConFIT, a contrastive learning framework for financial text extraction using a Semantic-Preserving Perturbation (SPP) engine to generate hard negatives. While the problem addressed is relevant, the paper suffers from serious methodological issues, most notably an unexplained catastrophic failure in the \"Synthetic Multi\" configuration (validation F1 of 0.000 vs. training F1 of 0.611), which is acknowledged but not resolved. There are signs of data leakage or overly simplistic tasks, as indicated by rapid convergence and overfitting. The technical contribution is not novel, and the experimental setup lacks rigor, with no statistical significance testing, limited baselines, and insufficient ablation studies. The paper is reasonably well-written but poorly organized, with key details missing or relegated to the appendix. The work combines existing techniques without substantial innovation, and the claimed improvements are questionable due to methodological flaws. Reproducibility is hindered by missing or unclear implementation details and anomalous results. While limitations are discussed, the implications of the failures are not adequately addressed. Major concerns include unexplained experimental failures, suspicious convergence patterns, lack of statistical validation, limited novelty, and insufficient analysis of technical failures. The acknowledgment that the work is AI-generated raises further concerns about technical depth and result validation."

        "value": "The paper introduces ConFIT, a knowledge-guided contrastive framework for financial information extraction, featuring a Semantic-Preserving Perturbation (SPP) engine that generates hard negatives using domain resources and filters. Strengths include a timely focus on robustness in financial NLP, a sensible approach to negative synthesis, explicit discussion of training pitfalls, and some breadth in evaluation. However, the work is under-specified technically, lacking details on the SPP engine, integration of domain knowledge, contrastive objectives, and filter criteria. Empirical evaluation is weak, with no concrete comparative numbers, unexplained discrepancies in reported metrics, and major defects in the negative generation pipeline. Reproducibility is limited due to missing details and lack of code. The paper is not well-situated relative to prior work, and there are issues with clarity, consistency, and proper attribution. While the high-level approach is reasonable, it is not clearly novel and lacks strong evidence of outperforming baselines. Ethical considerations are acknowledged but not deeply analyzed. The reviewer recommends providing more technical detail, fixing pipeline anomalies, reporting comprehensive quantitative results, clarifying protocols, improving reproducibility, expanding related work, and discussing ethical risks. Overall, the idea is promising but the paper is currently under-specified and weakly validated, leading to a recommendation for rejection."
