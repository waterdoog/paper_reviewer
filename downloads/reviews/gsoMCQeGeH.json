        "value": "The paper proposes MT-ViT-CCHA, a multi-task framework for canine cardiomegaly assessment on thoracic X-rays, jointly performing keypoint detection for VHS measurement, heart size classification, and direct VHS regression. The model uses a ViT backbone, HRNet-inspired keypoint head, and a cross-attention module, with uncertainty-based multi-task loss weighting. Experiments on a ~2000-image dataset report a mean test classification accuracy of 81.8% (±1.38), improving over a standard ViT (77.5%), with ablations supporting the contribution of each component.\n\nStrengths include clear motivation for multi-task learning, sensible architectural choices, ablation studies, multiple training runs with standard deviations, responsible AI and reproducibility statements, and helpful visuals.\n\nMain weaknesses:\n1) The paper claims a three-task system but only reports classification accuracy; no quantitative metrics for keypoint detection or VHS regression are provided, undermining the central claim.\n2) Stronger baselines outperform the proposed model on classification; the practical significance of the improvement over ViT is unclear without superior VHS/keypoint outcomes.\n3) Methodological clarity gaps: cross-attention integration and patch-to-2D feature map transformation are under-specified; keypoint semantics and annotation protocol are missing.\n4) Dataset and evaluation protocol: no class distribution, per-class metrics, or external validation; unclear split strategy.\n5) Clinical framing: the inclusion of a “Small” heart size class is atypical and not justified.\n6) Baseline training details are insufficient for fair comparison.\n7) Minor typographical and notation issues.\n\nReproducibility is partially supported by reported training details, but missing information for keypoint tasks and cross-attention specifics limits expert-level reproduction.\n\nEthics and limitations are discussed, but more emphasis on patient-wise splitting, privacy, and prospective validation is needed.\n\nActionable suggestions include reporting comprehensive metrics for all tasks, clarifying cross-attention integration, specifying feature map mappings, defining keypoints, ensuring fair baseline comparisons, considering external validation, and providing qualitative visualizations.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a promising multi-task design with useful ablations and clear writing, but lacks quantitative evaluation for key clinical tasks and underperforms established baselines on classification. The contribution is currently insufficient for a top venue, but could be strengthened with robust evaluation, methodological clarity, and fair comparisons.\n\nRecommendation: Borderline reject."

        "value": "Canine cardiomegaly diagnosis relies on the manual Vertebral Heart Score (VHS) measurement, a process that is both subjective and time-consuming. This research proposes a novel three-task deep learning system for the automatic detection of key anatomical points, classification of heart size, and regression of the VHS score from thoracic X-rays. Our MT-ViT-CCHA model utilizes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) for key-point detection, and a cross-attention mechanism to enable information sharing between the three tasks. MT-ViT-CCHA is trained end-to-end on a dataset of approximately 2000 canine thoracic X-rays with corresponding keypoint and VHS annotations. Our MT-ViT-CCHA approach achieves a mean classification accuracy of 81.8% on the test set, demonstrating superior performance compared to a standard Vision Transformer model (77.5%). These results highlight the effectiveness of MT-ViT-CCHA in providing a comprehensive and automated assessment of canine cardiac health."

The methodology is technically sound, with strong ablation studies validating each architectural component. The paper is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and highly reproducible, with detailed descriptions and a commitment to open science. The work addresses a significant clinical problem and offers a novel synthesis of established techniques for a holistic assessment approach. However, the main weakness is that the model's performance lags behind several state-of-the-art baselines, and the justification for this gap is insufficient. Suggestions include providing a more quantitative analysis of model complexity and applying the multi-task framework to stronger backbones. Additional clarity on baseline comparisons and reporting metrics for all tasks would further strengthen the work. Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution due to its methodological rigor, clarity, and reproducibility, despite not achieving state-of-the-art performance."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Multi-task evaluation mismatch: no quantitative metrics for keypoint detection (e.g., PCK, pixel/vertebral distance) or VHS regression (e.g., MAE, RMSE, correlation), despite claiming a comprehensive system (Fig. 1 on p.3; Sections 3–4).\n- Ablation design/reporting: Table 2 (p.7) reports classification accuracy for setups where the classification loss is inactive (e.g., 'Keypoint Only', 'VHS Regression Only'); should instead report metrics pertinent to the active tasks.\n- Class imbalance not quantified; only accuracy is reported (Table 1 on p.6). Absent metrics such as macro-F1, per-class recall/precision, AUC, and calibration; confusion matrices (Fig. 3 on p.7) lack numeric rates.\n- Baseline comparisons (Table 1 on p.6) lack hyperparameter tuning and training protocol details per model; no error bars for baselines; fairness of comparisons unclear.\n- Loss-weighting ablation (Table 2 on p.7) omits the exact fixed weights used, limiting reproducibility and interpretability.\n- Potential data leakage: splits are at image level (p.4), with no assurance of patient-level separation if multiple images per dog exist.\n- Augmentation-label consistency not specified: horizontal flips require correct keypoint remapping; details are missing (p.3).\n- Heatmap resolution (H′, W′) and σ relative to image scale are unspecified (p.3–4); may impact localization accuracy and its evaluation.\n- Cross-attention implementation details (number of heads, depth, placement) are sparse (p.4), and the mechanism's interaction across tasks is under-specified.\n- Keypoint head described as HRNet-inspired but is essentially a simple deconvolutional upsampler (p.3); this is acceptable but should be framed precisely."

The paper is technically sound, with a well-designed architecture and thorough experimental validation, including ablation studies and clear mathematical formulations. The clarity of writing, organization, and reproducibility are excellent, with detailed methodology, implementation specifics, and a promise to release code. The work addresses a significant problem in veterinary medicine, achieving a notable improvement over baseline methods, though the impact is somewhat limited to this domain and the performance gains are not groundbreaking. The originality lies in the novel combination and adaptation of established techniques for a less-explored application area. Ethical considerations and limitations are thoughtfully discussed, and the related work is comprehensively covered. Strengths include the robust architecture, strong validation, reproducibility, and practical relevance. Weaknesses are limited novelty, modest performance improvements, small dataset size, restriction to X-rays, and somewhat limited baseline comparisons. Overall, this is solid engineering work with meaningful practical contribution and high quality of execution, meriting acceptance."
