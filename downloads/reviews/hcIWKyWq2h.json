        "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language tasks but their strategic decision-making in interactive, multi-agent scenarios—critical for applications like negotiation systems or social simulations—remains understudied. This paper examines twelve anonymized LLMs in six multi-player game theory scenarios, encompassing cooperative, betraying, and sequential categories, with ten agents per instance across repeated rounds and multiple runs. We propose the Strategic Rationality Score (SRS), a novel composite metric normalizing deviations from Nash equilibria across games, enabling quantitative benchmarking of LLM rationality. Our findings reveal inconsistent equilibrium-seeking behavior, weak correlations with architectural features like parameter size, and minimal adaptation over interactions, suggesting inherent limitations in opponent modeling and long-term reasoning. These results contrast with expectations from scaling laws and highlight biases toward short-term gains. Contributions include SRS for cross-game evaluation, large-scale multi-player simulations (360 instances), and linkages to LLM traits, advancing AI behavioral analysis for safer multi-agent deployments.

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Incorrect and inconsistent numerical reporting in the main text vs. the supplementary outputs (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, correlations, regression MSE; pages 4–7).\n- SRS metric is ill-defined across heterogeneous games: it reduces multi-dimensional or non-unique equilibria to a single scalar target, likely mismeasuring rationality (especially for Divide Dollar and sequential games). No clear definition of D_g and o_r for all games.\n- Equilibrium specification for the Pirate Game appears incorrect or unjustified and inconsistent with the stated N=10 setting; sequential games’ equilibria are not rigorously defined.\n- Adaptation analysis for H3 seems to test over ‘runs’ instead of ‘rounds’ (see Figure 3 caption on page 6 and mixed model formula), misaligning with the RQ about within-run temporal learning.\n- Arbitrary SRS weights (0.4/0.4/0.2) without justification or sensitivity analysis; potential to bias conclusions.\n- H2 relies on descriptive statistics without a formal significance test, yet the checklist claims significance reporting.\n- Statistical methodology choices (t-test/ANOVA) with small samples and unverified assumptions; multiple comparison issues not addressed.\n- Regression analysis lacks baseline and cross-validation; reported MSE in text conflicts with the supplementary result.\n- Features used in correlation/prediction (e.g., Theory of Mind, strategic depth) are not operationalized in the Methods, limiting interpretability and reproducibility.\n- Use of a single LLM for all agents per simulation (cloned agents) may induce artifacts; implications not discussed.\n- Citation hygiene issues (e.g., [24] acknowledged as unrelated/hallucinated)."
