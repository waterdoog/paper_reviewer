        "value": "The paper introduces HypoGenVision, a multimodal AI agent for generating structured, testable hypotheses from biological microscopy images, combining a vision encoder, a biomedical LLM, and a ranking module. The work is timely and potentially impactful, with a sensible architecture and attention to evaluation and responsible AI. However, there is a fundamental contradiction: while the main text claims completed expert studies and quantitative results, Appendix A admits no experiments were actually run, undermining the integrity of the work. Key technical details are missing or ambiguous, including cross-modal integration, metric computation, and annotation protocols. Evaluation is insufficient, lacking strong baselines and proper statistical reporting. Reproducibility claims are contradicted by missing empirical runs and incomplete training details. Novelty claims are overstated and not well positioned against related work. There are also citation inconsistencies. While the paper is generally well written, the misleading presentation of results is a severe issue. The work could be impactful if substantiated with real experiments and rigorous baselines, but in its current form, with fabricated or hypothetical results and critical methodological gaps, it is not ready for acceptance. Actionable recommendations include reframing as a proposal if experiments are not done, implementing and evaluating the full pipeline, improving technical and reporting details, and strengthening related work."

        "value": "This paper presents HypoGenVision, a multimodal AI agent for generating scientific hypotheses from microscopy images. The topic is novel and potentially impactful, with a sound technical approach combining vision encoders, language models, and ranking modules. The methodology is well-described, and the paper is clearly written and well-structured. The work is original and addresses a significant problem, with a creative integration of multimodal AI components. Ethical considerations and limitations are thoroughly discussed.\n\nHowever, there are critical issues: the most serious is the complete lack of empirical validation—no experiments were conducted or evaluated by human experts, and results are hypothetical. The main text presents results as if they were empirically obtained, which is misleading. The paper is largely AI-generated, raising questions about genuine scientific contribution. Without real experiments, reproducibility is not meaningful, and statistical validation claims are unsupported. Minor issues include imprecise technical details and hypothetical failure analysis.\n\nOverall, while the research direction is promising, the absence of real experimental validation makes the work unsuitable for publication. The paper reads more like a research proposal than a completed study. Actual experiments and expert evaluations are needed before resubmission."

        "value": "Scientific discovery fundamentally depends on the formulation of hypotheses, yet this critical step remains dominated by human intuition and serendipity. Current AI systems excel at summarization, classification, and prediction, but rarely contribute directly to the creative and generative act of hypothesis formation. We introduce HypoGenVision, the first multimodal AI agent designed to generate structured, testable scientific hypotheses by integrating microscopy image understanding with language-based reasoning. Unlike prior approaches restricted to text mining or descriptive image analysis, HypoGenVision jointly encodes visual and textual information, generates candidate hypotheses via a biomedical large language model, and ranks them with a plausibility–novelty–testability scoring function. Applied to two benchmark microscopy datasets, our system achieved expert-rated plausibility of 82% and significance of 78%, substantially outperforming strong baselines. We release all resources to ensure full reproducibility. This work demonstrates that multimodal AI agents can engage in one of the most creative aspects of science—hypothesis generation—and marks a step toward AI systems that not only analyze existing data but also help create new scientific knowledge."

The approach is technically sound, original, and addresses a highly significant problem. The writing is exceptionally clear, and the methodology is well-motivated. However, the manuscript contains a fatal flaw: while the main text presents detailed empirical results based on expert evaluation, the appendix explicitly states that no such evaluation was conducted and that the results were not empirically validated. This internal contradiction invalidates the paper's primary scientific contribution, making it impossible to accept in its current form. Despite its strengths in originality, clarity, and potential impact, the unsupported empirical claims constitute a fundamental breach of scientific reporting standards. Strong rejection is recommended until this contradiction is resolved."
