        "value": "This paper presents \"Agentic AutoSurvey,\" a multi-agent framework for automated literature survey generation that employs four specialized agents to generate comprehensive surveys. The technical approach is sound, with a logical decomposition into four agents (Paper Search, Topic Mining & Clustering, Academic Survey Writer, Quality Evaluator) and appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental setup is reasonable but limited to one baseline and LLM-related topics. The 12-dimensional evaluation framework is comprehensive and an improvement over simpler metrics. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear system architecture and agent specifications, though some sections could be more concise and highlight key innovations more clearly. The work addresses an important problem and shows a substantial 71% improvement over the baseline, but its impact is limited by the narrow evaluation scope. The originality lies mainly in the comprehensive evaluation framework and the combination of specialized agents, though individual components are incremental. Reproducibility is good, with detailed implementation information and a commitment to releasing code and data, though some orchestration details could be clearer. Limitations and ethical considerations are well-addressed, including scalability, domain specificity, and evaluation subjectivity. Major strengths include empirical improvements, comprehensive evaluation, clear architecture, and practical relevance. Weaknesses include limited evaluation scope, unclear generalizability, incremental contributions, scalability issues, and reliance on AI. Minor issues include processing time, potential gaps in agent-based evaluation, and some complex formulations. Overall, this is a solid empirical paper with meaningful contributions, though broader evaluation and more baselines would strengthen it further."

        "value": "The paper proposes Agentic AutoSurvey, a multi-agent system for automated literature surveys with four specialized roles and a 12-dimensional agent-as-judge evaluation. The system uses standard clustering methods (sentence-transformer embeddings, K-means with silhouette-based K selection) and emphasizes synthesis-oriented writing. Experiments on six COLM 2024 topics claim large gains over the AutoSurvey baseline (average 8.18 vs 4.77), but the evaluation relies solely on the authors’ own agent-judge, with no independent human assessment or external benchmarks. The baseline comparison is confounded by differences in model size and retrieval sources, and there is a lack of statistical rigor (no uncertainty estimates, significance testing, or inter-run variance reported). Quantitative reporting is incomplete: key metrics like citation coverage, word counts, and factual consistency are not substantiated with data. Only one baseline is empirically compared, and the system is tested only on LLM-related domains. Reproducibility is limited by missing implementation details and the absence of released code or data. The system’s components are individually standard, with the main novelty being their combination and the evaluation rubric, but without strong validation, it is unclear if the gains are due to the architecture or confounding factors. The review recommends rejection in the current form, suggesting the need for rigorous human evaluation, fairer and broader baselines, detailed quantitative reporting, and released artifacts to strengthen the contribution."

The architecture is well-motivated, technically sound, and the paper is clearly written. The introduction of a comprehensive 12-dimensional evaluation framework is a notable contribution, and the discussion of limitations and ethics is thorough and responsible. However, the primary weakness is a fundamentally flawed experimental evaluation: the comparison to the baseline is invalid due to the use of a much weaker model for the baseline than for the proposed system, making the claimed performance improvements unconvincing. Additionally, some reproducibility details are missing. While the ideas and writing are strong, the methodological flaw in the main experiment is critical, and the paper cannot be recommended for acceptance until a fair empirical evaluation is conducted."

        "value": "The exponential growth of scientific literature poses unprecedented challenges for researchers attempting to synthesise knowledge across rapidly evolving fields. We present \\textbf{Agentic AutoSurvey}, a multi-agent framework for automated survey generation that addresses fundamental limitations in existing approaches. Our system employs four specialised agents (Paper Search Specialist, Topic Mining \\& Clustering, Academic Survey Writer, and Quality Evaluator) working in concert to generate comprehensive literature surveys with superior synthesis quality. Through experiments on six representative LLM research topics from COLM 2024 categories, we demonstrate that our multi-agent approach achieves significant improvements over existing baselines, scoring 8.18/10 compared to AutoSurvey's 4.77/10. The multi-agent architecture enables processing of large paper collections (up to 847 papers) while maintaining high citation coverage (80\\%+) and synthesis quality through specialized agent orchestration. Our comprehensive 12-dimensional evaluation framework provides nuanced quality assessment beyond traditional metrics, revealing that specialized agent decomposition produces surveys with superior organization, synthesis integration, and critical analysis compared to existing automated approaches. These findings demonstrate that multi-agent architectures represent a meaningful advancement for automated literature survey generation in rapidly evolving scientific domains."
