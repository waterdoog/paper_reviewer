        "value": "Philosophical inquiry unfolds as a network of ideas, debates, and thinkers. We present the Philosophy Knowledge Graph, a structured map derived from the complete Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that converts narrative prose into entities and relations suitable for analysis. The construction process is semi automatic: large language models extract people, concepts, and claims from encyclopedia text, and a stronger model reviews selected outputs to confirm support in context. The resulting resource includes over one hundred forty thousand nodes and more than one hundred thousand links, enabling querying, exploration, and comparative study. We illustrate its use with a comparative examination of aesthetics and ethics, revealing different patterns of citation, temporal focus, and collaboration, alongside meaningful overlap that reflects cross field influence. Beyond these cases, the graph supports questions about lineage, influence, and conceptual neighborhoods at a scale that complements close reading, while preserving links back to the passages that ground each relation. This work offers a general method for transforming long form scholarship into structured data and provides a shared foundation for future research in computational approaches to philosophy and for downstream natural language processing tasks."

The project is ambitious and aims to provide a foundational resource for computational philosophy, with an interesting comparative analysis of Aesthetics and Ethics. However, the paper suffers from critical flaws that undermine its validity and credibility. The core issue is the low accuracy (0.485) of the citation extraction pipeline, which makes the entire knowledge graph unreliable. There are also serious factual errors, such as impossible date ranges (e.g., citations up to the year 5024) and claims of using a non-existent model (GPT-5), which suggest a lack of oversight and possible fabrication. The paper lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility, omits crucial methodological information, and does not provide code or prompts. While the idea is significant and original, the execution is deeply flawed, and the limitations section fails to address the most critical issues. The paper cannot be accepted in its current form and requires a complete re-execution and rewrite to meet scientific standards."

        "value": "This paper presents the Philosophy Knowledge Graph (PhilKG), which extracts structured knowledge from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy using LLM-based methods. While the work addresses an interesting application area and demonstrates technical competency in knowledge graph construction, it has several significant limitations that prevent acceptance at a top-tier venue.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe technical approach is reasonable but not novel - it combines standard HTML parsing, regex-based extraction, and LLM validation. The extraction pipeline achieves modest performance (76% author recognition, 48.5% citation extraction accuracy), which raises concerns about data quality. The 84% reduction in false positives is claimed as a contribution, but the baseline performance is not clearly established. The LLM-as-a-judge validation is interesting but underexplored - only 20 sample articles were used for validation, which is insufficient for a dataset of 1,786 articles.\n\nClarity and Reproducibility:\nThe paper is generally well-written but lacks crucial implementation details. While the authors claim to store \"all prompts and generated codes,\" these are not provided in the submission. The methodology section mentions specific tools (BeautifulSoup, NetworkX) but lacks sufficient detail for reproduction. The deduplication framework is described at a high level without concrete algorithms or thresholds.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThe contribution is primarily in application rather than methodological innovation. While the resulting knowledge graph (144K nodes, 116K edges) is substantial, the analysis is limited to a simple comparison between two philosophical fields (Aesthetics vs Ethics). The insights gained (10.7× difference in citation density, 13.3× difference in network density) are interesting but represent fairly straightforward network statistics rather than deep philosophical insights.\n\nOriginality:\nThe work lacks methodological novelty - knowledge graph construction from text is well-established, and the LLM-based extraction follows standard approaches. The application to philosophy is somewhat novel, but the analysis techniques are standard network science methods. The comparison to existing knowledge graphs in other domains is superficial.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. Limited Evaluation: The evaluation is restricted to two philosophical subfields with only basic network metrics. No comparison to human-constructed knowledge graphs or gold standard philosophical taxonomies is provided.\n2. Data Quality Issues: The modest extraction accuracy scores and lack of comprehensive validation across the full dataset raise concerns about the reliability of downstream analyses.\n3. Shallow Analysis: The philosophical insights are limited to basic citation patterns and network statistics. The work doesn't engage with deeper questions about philosophical knowledge representation or contribute meaningfully to computational philosophy.\n4. Methodological Gaps: The keyword-based field classification is acknowledged as oversimplified, and the temporal analysis relies on potentially error-prone publication year extraction.\n\nEthics and AI Involvement:\nThe extensive AI involvement (marked as [D] for most categories) raises questions about the depth of human insight and validation. While transparency about AI use is appreciated, the minimal human contribution to analysis and interpretation is concerning for work claiming to provide insights into philosophical discourse.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Several formatting inconsistencies and incomplete sections (e.g., \"[TODO]\" placeholders)\n- References are adequate but could better situate the work within digital humanities\n- Some claims are overstated given the limited evaluation\n\nThe work represents a solid engineering effort in applying existing techniques to a new domain, but lacks the methodological innovation, comprehensive evaluation, or deep insights expected at a top venue. The analysis remains at a surface level and doesn't substantially advance our understanding of either knowledge graph construction or computational approaches to philosophy."
