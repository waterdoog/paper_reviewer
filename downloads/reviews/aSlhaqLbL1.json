        "value": "The paper introduces TensorCompress, a framework for model compression using tensor program synthesis and hardware-aware rewriting, claiming significant improvements in compression ratio, latency, and energy efficiency with theoretical guarantees and broad applicability. However, the submission is incomplete, with many sections as placeholders, missing technical details, and insufficient experimental evidence. The technical core lacks precise definitions, formalization of hardware-aware rewrites, and operational cost models. Theoretical claims are unsubstantiated, and experimental results are weak, lacking accuracy metrics, methodological details, and reproducibility. The manuscript is unclear, omitting essential definitions and methodological explanations. While the vision is ambitious and potentially impactful, the absence of rigorous methods and credible evaluation undermines its significance. The originality is questionable, as the approach does not clearly differentiate itself from existing compiler-driven and compression methods. Reproducibility is not possible due to missing code, hyperparameters, and experimental protocols. Ethical considerations and limitations are not adequately discussed, and related work is insufficiently covered. Strengths include the ambitious direction and practical focus, but major weaknesses are the incomplete manuscript, missing technical content, unsubstantiated claims, and lack of engagement with related work. Actionable suggestions include replacing filler text with technical content, defining objectives and constraints, formalizing rewrite rules, providing rigorous experiments, and discussing broader impacts. Overall, despite a promising idea, the paper is not ready for publication due to its lack of technical substance and credible evaluation."

We present TensorCompress, a novel framework that uses tensor program synthesis to generate optimized computational graphs beyond conventional methods. Our approach combines automated program search with hardware-aware rewriting rules to produce compressed models that maintain accuracy while reducing inference time and memory footprint. Theoretical analysis proves optimality bounds for synthesized programs, and experiments on large-scale models show 50% better compression ratios than state-of-the-art quantization, with negligible accuracy loss across vision and language tasks. The framework demonstrates 3x speedup on edge devices and 70% energy savings in deployment scenarios."

        "value": "This paper presents TensorCompress, a framework for model compression using tensor program synthesis. While the topic is relevant and the claimed improvements are impressive, there are several serious concerns that lead to a rejection recommendation.\n\nQuality Issues: The paper contains large portions of placeholder Lorem ipsum text mixed with actual content, especially on pages 1-2, which is unacceptable for a scientific paper and suggests the work is incomplete or hastily assembled. The theoretical analysis is extremely shallow, with Theorem 1 claiming optimality but providing only a one-line proof reference without mathematical development. The experimental evaluation lacks crucial details about baselines, statistical significance testing, and proper comparison methodology.\n\nClarity Problems: The paper is poorly organized and difficult to follow. The mixing of Lorem ipsum text with real content makes it nearly impossible to extract the actual technical contributions. Algorithm 1 is oversimplified and lacks meaningful implementation details. Key concepts like \"hardware-aware rewrites\" and the synthesis search space are mentioned but not properly defined or explained.\n\nSignificance Concerns: The claimed results (50% better compression ratios, 3x speedup, 70% energy savings) would be significant if true, but are not supported by rigorous evaluation. The comparison is limited to basic quantization and pruning baselines, without considering more advanced compression techniques. The lack of statistical analysis and proper experimental controls undermines confidence in these claims.\n\nOriginality Questions: The paper does not clearly differentiate its approach from existing work in tensor compiler optimization (like TVM) and program synthesis. The related work section is superficial and does not adequately position the contribution within the broader landscape of model compression research.\n\nReproducibility Issues: The paper provides insufficient detail for reproduction. The synthesis algorithm is described at too high a level, hardware-specific rewrite rules are not specified, and experimental setup details are sparse. The checklist indicates only partial open access to data and code, further limiting reproducibility.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors mention search time limitations but do not adequately discuss potential negative impacts, such as increased training time or environmental cost of the synthesis search process.\n\nAdditional Concerns: The AI involvement checklist reveals the entire paper was AI-generated, including hypothesis development, experimental design, and writing. While allowed by conference guidelines, the quality issues suggest inadequate human oversight and validation of the AI-generated content.\n\nThe presence of Lorem ipsum text throughout the paper is particularly concerning as it suggests the work may not be complete or that the authors did not properly review the AI-generated content before submission."
