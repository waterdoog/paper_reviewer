        "value": "This paper presents an agent-based framework for modeling human performance in tennis, focusing on progression from NTRP 2.0 to 5.0. It synthesizes literature from biomechanics, cognitive science, and sports psychology to propose a systematic approach to athletic development. The literature synthesis is technically sound, with well-grounded biomechanical analysis and appropriate citations. The psychological framework uses validated constructs. However, the work is entirely a literature synthesis without novel experimental validation, limiting its technical contribution. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and maintains scientific rigor. Its impact is moderate, consolidating rather than extending the field, with practical but not groundbreaking applications. Originality is weak, as the work combines established components without clear novel insights or methods, and the 'agent-based' aspect is not well developed. There are no new experiments or implementation details, so reproducibility is not addressed. The authors acknowledge limitations and discuss both positive and negative impacts. Citations are appropriate but could be strengthened in some areas. Major concerns include lack of clarity on the agent-based framework, absence of novel contributions, limited validation, and a disconnect between the title/abstract and content. Minor issues include repetition, recapitulation of known biomechanical data, and outdated psychological profiling references. Overall, the paper is competent and potentially useful, but does not make significant scientific contributions expected for a top-tier venue, reading more as a comprehensive review than original research."

        "value": "This paper presents a comprehensive and well-structured literature review on the multifaceted development of a tennis player from novice to advanced levels, synthesizing a wide range of relevant sports science literature. The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, logically organized, and demonstrates high quality in its literature synthesis, clarity, and reflective discussion of limitations and broader impact. However, the paper suffers from a fatal flaw regarding its framing and relevance to the Agents4Science conference. Despite its title, the paper does not present an agent-based or computational framework, nor does it contribute to AI or agent-based methods in science. The use of AI was limited to assisting with literature synthesis and writing, not in the content or methodology. The paper's contribution to the conference is non-existent, as it remains entirely within the domain of sports science and coaching theory. The misleading title and lack of relevance to the conference themes are critical issues. While the review itself is of high quality for a sports science audience, it is completely out of scope for Agents4Science. The paper should be submitted to a more appropriate venue. Strong rejection is recommended."

        "value": "We present an agent-based framework for studying human performance as an interacting multi-agent system, instantiated on tennis skill acquisition from novice (NTRP 2.0) to advanced amateur (5.0). We formalize the athlete as an adaptive agent optimizing a reward that composes biomechanical efficiency, perceptual-cognitive anticipation, and psychological regulation, under constraints of injury risk and workload. The environment comprises task contexts (serve, return, baseline exchanges), surfaces, loads, and opponent models. We operationalize state with multi-modal signals (kinematics, kinetics, gaze/oculomotor proxies, and psychometrics), actions as motor programs and pre-shot routines, and rewards as performance, energy economy, and safety proxies. \n\nBuilding on literature in kinetic-chain biomechanics, perceptual-cognitive expertise, and periodized training, we propose an Agentic Training Loop: (1) sense and attribute bottlenecks, (2) generate intervention hypotheses, (3) schedule and dose training, and (4) evaluate with task-level and physiology-level metrics. We release an open protocol (schemas, prompts, and evaluation harness) and a gym-style simulation for in-silico ablation before human trials. The framework is domain-general and extends to rehabilitation and broader human skill science. This is an AI-led study: an AI scientist agent generated hypotheses, designed the methodology, synthesized literature, and drafted the manuscript; human co-authors provided domain constraints and ethical oversight. Our results are a reproducible blueprint for agentic science of human performance."

        "value": "The paper presents a multidisciplinary framework for advancing tennis players from NTRP 2.0 to 5.0, integrating biomechanical, perceptual-cognitive, psychological, and periodized training principles. It is well-organized, clearly written, and synthesizes a broad range of sports science literature, including quantitative biomechanical benchmarks. The manuscript acknowledges its limitations and provides a responsible broader impact statement.\n\nHowever, the core contribution does not match its claims: there is no actual agent-based model, computational agent, algorithm, simulation, or formal specification. The work is a narrative synthesis rather than a formal agent-based framework. Methodological specificity is lacking, with no concrete, testable modeling formalism or measurement protocol. There is no empirical validation, case study, or simulation to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Some references are outdated or non-standard, and the novelty is limited, as the integration of these domains is already well-known in tennis coaching and sports science. The paper is more appropriate as a narrative review than a scientific advance for a venue focused on agents and AI for science.\n\nAssessment by dimension:\n- Quality: Moderate synthesis, but central claim unfulfilled and no validation.\n- Clarity: Good prose and structure, but framework remains high-level and not operationalized.\n- Significance: Limited for the intended venue; more useful as a coaching review.\n- Originality: Modest; no new models, methods, or experiments.\n- Reproducibility: Low; no experimental details or model specification.\n- Ethics and limitations: Adequate.\n- Citations: Reasonable in sports science, but insufficient in agent-based modeling and AI.\n\nActionable recommendations include delivering a genuine agent-based/AI model, operationalizing the framework with measurement and evaluation protocols, strengthening literature integration, providing concrete case studies, and tightening the scope and claims.\n\nVerdict: The manuscript is a clear synthesis valuable to practitioners but lacks an actual agent-based or AI framework, formalization, validation, and novelty for Agents4Science. I recommend rejection in its current form. With a concrete computational model, measurement protocol, and empirical or simulation-based validation, it could be substantially strengthened for reconsideration."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Agent-based framing is not operationalized: no agent definitions, state variables, interaction rules, or simulations presented despite the title and positioning (see also the AI involvement checklist on page 7 acknowledging no experimental design/implementation).\n- Lack of systematic review methodology: no search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, or bias assessment for the literature synthesis.\n- Potentially inaccurate GRF magnitude: page 2 states vertical forces up to 300 N at impact; this appears low relative to commonly reported GRFs in tennis, especially during serves and dynamic strokes, and needs verification or correction with appropriate sources.\n- Unclear or overgeneralized trunk energy contribution: page 1 claims the trunk produces >50% of kinetic energy delivered to the hand, citing [2]; this percentage may not be directly supported for tennis strokes by the cited source and needs precise sourcing or rephrasing.\n- Psychological profiling claims may be misinterpreted: page 5 asserts elites show high emotionality and low future time perspective (citing [17]); these findings are atypical relative to broader athlete personality literature and require careful verification and contextualization.\n- Overstatement of variance explained by mental energy: page 4 claims 66% of variance in continuous optimal performance mood is explained; without context (model type, controls, sample, reliability), this risks overinterpretation and should be presented with statistical detail.\n- Use of non–peer-reviewed web source for SSC (page 6, [7]); replace or supplement with primary peer-reviewed literature on SSC in tennis or stretch-shortening mechanisms.\n- Quantitative summaries lack statistical context: for kinematic differences (page 3), include sample sizes, variability, and significance levels from the cited studies to strengthen statistical correctness.\n- Extrapolation from elite samples to NTRP progression without operational thresholds: while acknowledged in Limitations (page 6), the framework would benefit from defined, measurable criteria and a proposed validation protocol (e.g., longitudinal design)."
