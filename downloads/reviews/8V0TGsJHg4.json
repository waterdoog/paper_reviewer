        "value": "This paper presents an AI-generated ab initio variational calculation of the first excitation energy of the lithium atom, with the entire workflow produced by an AI agent and results unverified by humans. The main contribution is the demonstration of an end-to-end AI-driven scientific project, implementing a variational method with a minimal Slater-type orbital basis set in Julia. The reported excitation energy closely matches the experimental value. \n\nHowever, the paper suffers from critical flaws. The most significant is a fundamental misrepresentation of its methodology: it claims to use a hybrid Classical-Quantum approach and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), but the described method is purely classical and standard in quantum chemistry, with no quantum computing elements. This confusion undermines the paper's framing. Additionally, the scientific discussion is shallow, failing to address the limitations of the simple physical model used and the likely fortuitous nature of the high accuracy reported. The originality is limited to the AI-driven process, as the scientific method itself is not novel. The paper is generally well-written and detailed enough for reproduction, but the lack of released code is a major barrier to verification. The literature review is broad but unfocused, and the related work section does not properly contextualize the calculation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper is a valuable demonstration of AI's potential in science, its scientific merit is undermined by methodological misrepresentation and lack of critical discussion. Major revisions are required for accuracy and rigor. The paper is not acceptable in its current form."

        "value": "This paper presents an ab initio calculation of the first excitation energy of lithium atom using a minimal Slater-type orbital basis set implemented in Julia. While the topic is scientifically relevant, there are several significant concerns that impact the paper's quality and acceptability.\n\nQuality Issues: The paper has fundamental technical problems. The claimed excitation energy is significantly higher than the experimental value, and there is a lack of rigorous validation. The methodology description lacks sufficient technical detail, with incomplete energy expressions, vague integration schemes, and an unclear optimization procedure. Claims of implementing exact integrals are not substantiated with mathematical formulation or validation.\n\nClarity Problems: The paper is poorly organized and unclear. The methods section lacks logical flow, mathematical notation is inconsistent, and key technical details are missing. Figures are simplistic and add little value. The writing is verbose and contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.\n\nSignificance Concerns: The contribution is incremental, as computing lithium excitation energies with minimal basis sets is well-established. The paper does not demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods, and claimed computational efficiency gains are not substantiated.\n\nOriginality Questions: The main novelty is the implementation in Julia, but the underlying methodology is standard. The paper does not clearly distinguish itself from existing approaches beyond the programming language.\n\nReproducibility Issues: Critical information for reproducibility is missing, including mathematical formulations, algorithmic descriptions, convergence criteria, computational resource requirements, and code availability. The provided information is insufficient for replication.\n\nAI-Generated Content Concerns: The authors state that all results are AI-generated and unverified by humans, raising concerns about accuracy and scientific rigor. Many citations appear tangential or incorrectly applied, suggesting automated literature inclusion.\n\nAdditional Issues: The reference list is excessively long and contains many irrelevant citations. There is no proper error analysis, uncertainty quantification, comparison with high-accuracy benchmarks, or discussion of method limitations. The theoretical foundation lacks rigor and precision."

The reported excitation energy is close to known values, and some technical choices (e.g., nonuniform grid) are reasonable. However, the submission suffers from major issues: internal inconsistencies regarding the claimed exactness of integrals versus numerical quadrature, vague methodological details (especially regarding wavefunction construction and open-shell treatment), superficial validation (only a single excitation energy reported, no convergence or sensitivity studies), and a lack of reproducibility (no code, insufficient implementation details). The narrative is often unclear and cluttered with tangential buzzwords, and the reference list contains many off-topic or fabricated entries, undermining scholarly integrity. The claimed use of advanced methods (VQE, LR-TDDFT, DMFT) is not substantiated. The paper is not ready for publication and requires a substantial rewrite with rigorous mathematics, focused scope, thorough validation, reproducible code, and corrected citations. Recommendation: Reject."
