The central experiment is simple yet powerful, and the paper is generally well-written with a clear argument. However, the work suffers from a critical lack of scientific rigor: there is no quantification of results, unsupported claims are made, and key data are presented without explanation or methodology. The manuscript also contains numerous inconsistencies and careless errors, such as mismatched model descriptions and incorrect references. While the core idea is significant and promising, the execution is insufficient for publication. Major revisions are required to address methodological rigor, data transparency, and presentation quality. Therefore, I recommend rejection in its current form."

        "value": "The paper introduces the concepts of \"cognitive inertia\" and \"contextual contamination\" to describe how multimodal LLMs can be biased by dominant semantic contexts, leading to errors such as miscounting visual elements. The phenomenon is interesting and relevant, especially for medical AI, and the paper is clear at a high level with helpful image sets. However, the evaluation is largely qualitative and anecdotal, lacking statistical rigor, quantitative results, and experimental controls. There are inconsistencies in the number of models evaluated, missing methodological details, and no human baseline for comparison. The work is not well-situated in the context of prior literature on related phenomena, and reproducibility is weak due to missing data, protocols, and analysis scripts. The significance of the findings is limited by the lack of systematic evaluation and mitigation analysis. The reviewer recommends substantial expansion and systematization of experiments, rigorous definitions, better situating within the literature, and tempering of strong claims. The verdict is to reject in its current form, but with improvements, the work could become a valuable contribution."

        "value": "This paper investigates limitations in multimodal AI systems, focusing on 'cognitive inertia' and 'contextual contamination.' While the topic is interesting and the framing provides some conceptual novelty, the paper suffers from significant technical and methodological limitations. The experimental design is extremely limited, with only 4 AI models tested on a small set of images, lacking statistical analysis, controls, and systematic variation. The methodology is unclear and insufficiently detailed for reproduction, with missing information about image presentation, evaluation criteria, and experimental protocol. The findings about contextual bias are not particularly novel and are overstated in terms of clinical implications. The reference list is very limited and fails to engage with substantial existing literature, representing a major weakness. Overall, the paper addresses an interesting question but lacks rigor, scope, and theoretical grounding, requiring substantial improvements to meet publication standards."

        "value": "Background: While state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models achieve human expert-level performance in specific medical imaging tasks, they exhibit fundamental limitations when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, committing seemingly basic errors that defy common-sense reasoning. This study extends beyond the known issue of AI’s anatomical common-sense deficits by exploring a “hierarchical error” mechanism wherein one dominant context distorts the interpretation of adjacent, logically unrelated information.\n\nMethods: We designed a multi-stage qualitative experimental framework. First, we established baseline performance by presenting several cutting-edge multimodal AI systems with standard radiological images and normal anatomical illustrations. Next, we observed common-sense failures by testing the models on anatomically impossible (“nonsensical”) images. Finally, we assessed AI responses to an abstract image of six converging lines both in isolation and when paired with an abnormal six-fingered hand emoji.\n\nResults: The AI systems performed with high accuracy on standard medical images and normal illustrations, but they completely failed to recognize the inherent impossibility of the nonsensical images. Most significantly, when the abstract line image was presented alone, the AI correctly identified six lines; however, when the identical image was shown alongside the abnormal hand emoji, the AI incorrectly reported five lines. This demonstrates how a powerful semantic context (in this case, “hand = five”) can hierarchically dominate and contaminate the processing of visual information in an otherwise unrelated image.\n\nConclusions: AI’s most fundamental errors extend beyond simple pattern-recognition failures. They stem from structural limitations characterized by “cognitive inertia” (entrenchment in dominant prior assumptions) and “contextual contamination” (distortion of surrounding information by those assumptions). This represents a critical limitation that cannot be resolved with prompt engineering or other user-level fixes alone. Human critical thinking and oversight therefore remain essential to complement AI’s autonomous diagnostic capabilities."
