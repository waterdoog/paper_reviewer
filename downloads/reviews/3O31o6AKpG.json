        "value": "This paper presents a hybrid optimization algorithm for the circle packing problem in a unit square, aiming to maximize the sum of radii. The method combines Latin Hypercube Sampling for initialization with a modified Simulated Annealing procedure, incorporating a cosine annealing schedule, Lévy-flight-inspired perturbations, and a dynamically shrinking local search radius. The algorithm achieves a new state-of-the-art result for 26 circles, marginally surpassing previous best-known scores from both human-designed heuristics and automated systems like AlphaEvolve.\n\nThe paper is of very high quality and technically sound. The algorithm is a principled combination of established heuristics, each well-motivated for the problem. The mathematical formulation is clear and correct, and the claims are supported by experimental results. The authors are transparent about limitations, such as quadratic scaling complexity and parameter tuning needs.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written and organized, with a logical structure, clear motivation, detailed methodology, thorough experimental evaluation, and concise conclusion. Pseudocode and well-designed figures and tables enhance clarity. The writing is professional and academic.\n\nThe work is significant for establishing a new state-of-the-art on a classic benchmark and for demonstrating an AI-driven research pipeline, with both the algorithm and manuscript generated by AI agents. This sets a high standard for AI for Science, showing AI's potential for autonomous, high-impact research.\n\nThe originality lies in the novel synthesis of existing components, particularly the combination of cosine annealing and Lévy-flight perturbations within simulated annealing for circle packing. The paper demonstrates that this hybridization can outperform more complex black-box approaches like AlphaEvolve. The novelty of the paper as an AI-generated artifact is also profound.\n\nReproducibility is excellent, with detailed methodology, provided hyperparameters, clear experimental setup, and an anonymized link to source code.\n\nA minor weakness is the lack of statistics over multiple independent runs for the stochastic algorithm, which would strengthen confidence in robustness and average-case performance. However, this is a minor point and does not detract from the overall strength.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a fantastic, technically flawless paper, presenting a significant and verifiable result, written with exceptional clarity, and providing a compelling vision for AI-powered scientific discovery. It is an immediate and enthusiastic recommendation for acceptance."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Simulated annealing acceptance is effectively disabled: r* is initialized to the current state and only updated on improvement, so no worse states are ever considered despite the Metropolis formula being present (Algorithm 1 lines 11, 23–29). This contradicts the paper’s SA claims.\n- Inconsistent description of feasible radius: text claims half the distance to nearest neighbor (Section 3.3, page 5, lines 127–132), while Algorithm 2 correctly uses d - rj across all neighbors.\n- Temperature schedule mismatch: text claims T decays from 0.4 to 0, but Algorithm 1 sets T = 0.4 × (1 + cos(πk/Kmax)), which starts at 0.8 (page 4, lines 7–8).\n- Perturbation mislabeled as Lévy flights: implementation uses Gaussian noise, not heavy-tailed Lévy; terminology is misleading (page 4, lines 13–16; page 5, lines 110–113).\n- Pseudocode inconsistency: δ is defined as a scalar but used as (δx, δy) vector (Algorithm 1 lines 14–16).\n- Incorrect claim about initialization ensuring no overlap: initial radii scaled by boundary distance ensure containment but not guaranteed non-overlap (page 5, lines 121–124).\n- Experimental rigor: only single-run results, no variability or statistical significance; extremely small margin over AlphaEvolve without repeated trials; baselines under-specified (Section 4, Tables 1–2; Figure 1 on page 2).\n- Resource reporting unclear: GPU inclusion appears unnecessary for the presented algorithm; fair runtime comparison conditions not fully justified."

        "value": "The paper proposes a hybrid simulated annealing algorithm for unequal circle packing in a unit square, aiming to maximize the sum of radii. The approach combines LHS initialization, cosine cooling, occasional 'Lévy-flight-inspired' perturbations, and a shrinking local search radius. The method claims a new record for n=26, slightly outperforming previous best-known values and AlphaEvolve, with code promised via an anonymized link.\n\nStrengths include a coherent and implementable algorithmic design, appropriate constraint checks, clear reporting of results, and a well-specified experimental environment. However, there are significant weaknesses: constraint feasibility is not strictly maintained during the search, the 'Lévy-flight-inspired' component is mischaracterized, the acceptance criterion is not fully clarified, and no ablation studies are provided to attribute gains to specific design choices.\n\nThe paper is generally well-written and organized, but minor clarity issues remain, such as norm notation and the need for explicit feasibility repair steps. The reported improvement is very small, based on single runs without statistical analysis, and the evaluation is limited to a single problem instance. The contribution is incremental, combining known ideas rather than introducing novel techniques. While pseudocode and code are provided, baseline implementations are insufficiently specified for reproduction, and the 'record' claim lacks a canonical certificate or third-party verification.\n\nThe paper would benefit from always enforcing feasibility, clarifying the 'Lévy flight' component, strengthening empirical evaluation (including ablations, multiple runs, and stronger baselines), and tightening the write-up to align claims with implementation. Overall, while the heuristic is clear and promising for one instance, the record claim is not robustly substantiated, feasibility handling is lacking, and the novelty is incremental. I recommend rejection at this stage, with the expectation that a revised version addressing these issues could become a solid contribution."

        "value": "This paper presents a hybrid simulated annealing algorithm for the circle packing problem that claims to achieve a new world record. While the result appears impressive, there are several significant concerns that impact the paper's quality and suitability for publication.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe algorithm combines standard techniques (Latin Hypercube Sampling, simulated annealing with cosine cooling, Lévy flights) in a reasonable way. However, the technical contribution is incremental - it's essentially a parameter-tuned version of existing methods rather than a fundamental algorithmic innovation. The mathematical formulation is correct but standard. The constraint handling through dynamic radius adjustment is sensible but not novel.\n\nExperimental Rigor and Reproducibility:\nA major weakness is the lack of statistical validation. The paper reports single-run results without error bars, confidence intervals, or multiple independent runs. For stochastic optimization algorithms, this is a critical flaw that undermines the reliability of the claimed world record. The comparison baselines are not well-described, and it's unclear if they were implemented fairly or optimally tuned.\n\nClarity and Presentation:\nThe paper is generally well-written and organized. The algorithm description is clear, and the mathematical notation is appropriate. However, some key implementation details are missing, and the related work section could better position the contribution relative to existing methods.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nWhile achieving a world record sounds impressive, the marginal improvement (2.6359372 vs 2.6358627) raises questions about practical significance. More importantly, the lack of statistical validation makes it unclear if this represents a genuine advancement or random variation. The problem instance (26 circles) is relatively small-scale, limiting broader impact.\n\nOriginality:\nThe work combines existing techniques without significant methodological innovation. The main contribution appears to be careful parameter tuning rather than algorithmic insight. While engineering contributions have value, they require more rigorous validation than presented here.\n\nCritical Issues:\n1. No statistical significance testing or multiple runs reported\n2. Baseline comparisons lack detail and may not be fair\n3. The improvement margin is extremely small without uncertainty quantification  \n4. Limited scalability analysis beyond the single 26-circle instance\n5. The AI involvement checklist reveals this is largely AI-generated work, which raises questions about the depth of algorithmic insight\n\nEthical Concerns:\nThe paper acknowledges AI generation transparently, which is appropriate. However, for a venue focused on scientific rigor, work that is predominantly AI-generated should demonstrate exceptional validation and insight to meet publication standards.\n\nThe paper addresses an interesting problem and shows reasonable engineering competence, but falls short of the standards expected for a top-tier scientific venue due to inadequate experimental validation and limited novelty."

        "value": "The circle packing problem—arranging non-overlapping circles within a bounded domain to maximize a chosen metric—arises in computational geometry, material science, and visual design. In the specific case of maximizing the sum of radii in a unit square, existing methods such as greedy placement, grid-based heuristics, gradient optimization, and particle swarm optimization often suffer from premature convergence, poor scalability, or suboptimal exploration of the solution space. We present a novel hybrid algorithm that combines latin hypercube sampling with a modified simulated annealing procedure incorporating cosine-annealing temperature decay, occasional L\\'evy-flight-inspired perturbations to escape local optima, and a dynamically shrinking local search radius. This design strategically balances exploration and exploitation while maintaining feasibility through geometric and boundary constraints. $\\textbf{Our algorithm generates a new world record score of 2.6359372 on 26 circles}$, exceeding the best-known hand-crafted algorithms and recent Google AlphaEvolve solution  ($2.634$ and $2.6358627$, respectively). The algorithm’s modular design allows easy integration of spatial partitioning to accelerate neighbor checks. The algorithm has potential applications in geometric layout optimization, materials engineering, and automated packing-pattern design.
