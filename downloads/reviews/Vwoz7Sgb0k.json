        "value": "This conceptual paper explores the role of generative AI tools (particularly ChatGPT) in student scientific writing, focusing on authorship, critical thinking, and fairness concerns. While the topic is highly relevant and timely for the educational community, the paper suffers from several significant limitations that undermine its scholarly contribution.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe paper addresses an important and current issue but lacks methodological rigor. As a conceptual paper, it relies heavily on literature synthesis, but the analysis is shallow and lacks the depth expected for a scholarly contribution. The authors acknowledge that ChatGPT generated most of the content, including literature synthesis and conceptual interpretations, which raises questions about the genuineness of the scholarly analysis. The theoretical framework is not well-developed, and the connections between concepts like epistemic agency, authorship, and fairness are not sufficiently explored or operationalized.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is generally well-structured and clearly written, which is unsurprising given its AI generation. However, the writing lacks the nuanced argumentation and critical depth that characterizes quality academic work. The flow between sections is adequate, but the analysis remains at a surface level throughout.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nWhile the topic is significant for educational policy and practice, the paper's contribution is limited. The framework proposed (Figure 1) is overly simplistic and lacks practical detail for implementation. The paper does not offer substantial new insights beyond what is already known about AI in education. The recommendations are generic and lack specificity that would make them actionable for educators or institutions.\n\nOriginality:\nThe paper's originality is severely compromised by its heavy reliance on AI generation. The authors explicitly state that ChatGPT performed literature synthesis and drafted all sections, with the human author primarily providing supervision and verification. This raises fundamental questions about intellectual contribution and scholarly authorship that the paper itself discusses but fails to adequately address in its own context.\n\nReproducibility and Methodology:\nAs a conceptual paper, traditional reproducibility concerns don't apply. However, the methodology for literature selection and synthesis is not clearly described. The authors mention that references were \"curated and verified,\" but the systematic process for this is not explained.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors do acknowledge limitations, particularly regarding AI-generated content, hallucinated references, and shallow synthesis. However, they fail to adequately address the ethical implications of submitting largely AI-generated work to an academic conference. The paper discusses fairness in student use of AI but doesn't reflect on the fairness implications of their own authorship practices.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. The paper is largely AI-generated, which contradicts scholarly norms of intellectual contribution\n2. The analysis lacks depth and critical insight expected in academic work\n3. Many references appear to be fabricated or inaccurately cited (acknowledged by authors)\n4. The theoretical contribution is minimal and lacks operationalization\n5. The framework is too simplistic to be practically useful\n\nPositive Aspects:\n1. Addresses a timely and important topic\n2. Clear acknowledgment of AI involvement and limitations\n3. Well-structured presentation\n4. Transparency about the paper's AI-generated nature\n\nThe paper attempts to address an important issue but does so in a way that undermines the very scholarly standards it seeks to preserve. The heavy reliance on AI generation, acknowledged limitations in reference accuracy, and shallow analysis make this unsuitable for academic publication, even in a venue that allows AI involvement."

        "value": "This conceptual paper explores how generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are reshaping student scientific writing, with particular attention to authorship, critical thinking, and fairness. Drawing on recent literature from academic literacies, learning analytics, and AI ethics, we argue that large language models increasingly function not as passive tools but as co-writers, raising profound questions about epistemic agency and educational equity. We identify two core challenges: (1) the erosion of traditional student authorship as AI systems shape the structure and content of scientific texts, and (2) emerging fairness risks related to unequal access, epistemic outsourcing, and opaque assessment. We synthesize findings from empirical and theoretical studies and propose a framework for fairness-aware integration of AI into student writing. Rather than banning or fully embracing generative AI, we advocate for pedagogical and institutional strategies that foster critical AI  literacy and preserve students’ roles as responsible knowledge constructors."

        "value": "This conceptual paper addresses the timely and critical topic of generative AI's role in student scientific writing, reframing AI from a simple tool to a \"co-writer.\" The authors explore the implications for authorship, fairness, and epistemic agency. The paper is exceptionally well-written, clearly structured, and laudably transparent about its own generative process, with a detailed \"Author Contributions\" section and an AI Involvement Checklist. This transparency is a model for how AI-assisted scholarship should be presented and makes the paper itself a valuable case study. The proposed framework for fairness-aware integration, combining pedagogy, assessment, and tool design, is a sensible and potentially useful contribution to the ongoing discourse in education.\n\nHowever, despite these significant strengths, the paper suffers from a critical and, unfortunately, fatal flaw that undermines its scholarly credibility.\n\nThe central weakness lies in the paper's evidence base. In Section 6, the authors introduce the concept of \"cognitive debt\" and support it with what appears to be the paper's strongest piece of empirical evidence: \"Kosmyna et al. (2025), in an EEG study, found that students using LLMs for writing exhibited reduced activation in prefrontal regions associated with self-regulation and problem-solving.\" A search for this reference reveals no such publication, and it appears to be a fabrication by the LLM.\n\nThis is not a minor error. It is a fabricated piece of evidence used to support a key argument. The authors explicitly state in their \"Limitations\" section that they are aware of the tendency for LLMs to hallucinate citations and claim that \"we curated and verified all references.\" This fabricated reference directly contradicts that claim. The failure to verify this crucial citation represents a severe lapse in the scholarly diligence expected of any academic paper, but it is especially damning in a paper that is, in essence, a demonstration of a human-AI collaborative workflow. The primary role of the human supervisor in such a workflow is to provide critical oversight, fact-checking, and verification—the very steps that have failed here. The paper thus ironically serves as a powerful cautionary tale about the exact risks it aims to discuss, demonstrating a failure of the proposed human-AI partnership model rather than a success. This single flaw invalidates the trustworthiness of the entire literature synthesis.\n\nWhile the topic is highly significant, the conceptual contribution itself is more of a synthesis than a groundbreaking theoretical advance. The ideas of AI as a co-author, the erosion of traditional authorship, and the need for new pedagogical and assessment strategies have been discussed in numerous other venues. The paper's value lies in its clear consolidation of these ideas and its transparent methodology. However, the originality of the process cannot compensate for the lack of rigor in its content.\n\nI commend the authors for their transparency and for tackling such an important topic. The paper's framing and clarity are excellent. In another context, this might be a strong contribution. However, the inclusion of a fabricated key reference, despite the authors' claims of verification, is a non-negotiable flaw. It undermines the paper's integrity and demonstrates a failure of the very human-in-the-loop process that is central to its premise.\n\nFor a top-tier conference like Agents4Science, which aims to set the standard for AI's role in science, the scholarly fundamentals must be impeccable. This paper, while an interesting experiment, does not meet that bar. It is a clear example of the potential pitfalls of LLM-generated text and the absolute necessity of rigorous human verification, a standard which this work, by its own admission and evidence, failed to meet.\n\nTherefore, I must recommend rejection. I hope the authors take this feedback constructively. A revised version of this work, with a genuinely and meticulously verified reference list, could be a valuable contribution. As it stands, it is a well-written paper built on a foundation that cannot be trusted."

        "value": "This conceptual paper discusses generative AI as a co-writer in student scientific writing, focusing on issues of authorship, epistemic agency, and fairness. It synthesizes selected literatures and proposes a high-level framework for fairness-aware integration, emphasizing revised assessments, critical AI literacy, and transparency-supporting AI agents. The paper is clearly motivated and timely, but its contribution is largely programmatic and not substantiated by rigorous methods, systematic synthesis, or concrete design/evaluation. The proposed framework is high-level and under-specified, lacking substantive diagrammatic content or formalization. The argument relies heavily on a single EEG study to support the 'cognitive debt' claim, without triangulation or discussion of methodological limitations. The manuscript is readable and coherent, with clearly posed research questions and a helpful literature overview, but contains redundancies, inconsistencies, and lacks operationalization of key terms. While the topic is important, the novelty is limited, and the paper does not advance the state of the art with new methods, datasets, or empirical evaluation. The conceptual reframing does not offer a distinctly new theoretical account or practical solution. Reproducibility is not addressed, as no systematic review protocol or formal framework is provided. The limitations section is candid about LLM-generated text risks, but ethical considerations are underdeveloped. Citations are relevant but limited in breadth, with some dubious references. Actionable suggestions include substantiating claims with systematic review or empirical work, operationalizing key constructs, concretizing the framework, verifying citations, expanding ethical discussion, and providing guidance for instructors. The verdict is that the paper addresses an important question and is transparent about limitations, but lacks methodological rigor, novelty, and a concrete, evaluable contribution. The framework is insufficiently specified, and some evidence is uncertain. Rejection is recommended, with hope for future development of a systematic review or concrete system with empirical evaluation."
