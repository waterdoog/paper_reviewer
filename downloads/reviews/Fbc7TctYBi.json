        "value": "This paper presents an interesting and provocative perspective on hallucinations in large language models, reframing them as potential mechanisms for creativity rather than simply errors to be eliminated. The work introduces the Creative Utility Score (CUS) and an adaptive agent architecture to balance novelty with plausibility in AI-generated hypotheses.\n\nQuality:\nThe paper is technically sound with a well-structured approach. The Creative Utility Score provides a principled way to quantify the novelty-plausibility tradeoff, and the adaptive agent architecture with three operational modes (Exploratory, Grounding, Adaptive) is well-motivated. The experimental design covers two domains (mathematics and biomedicine) with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some concerns about the actual implementation - the paper lacks concrete experimental results and appears to be more of a conceptual framework with promised empirical validation rather than completed experiments.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is generally well-written and clearly organized. The conceptual framework is explained coherently, connecting hallucinations to divergent thinking in human creativity. The methodology section provides sufficient algorithmic detail, and the connection between theory and practice is well-articulated. The writing flows logically from motivation through methodology to experimental design.\n\nSignificance:\nThe core idea of reframing hallucinations as controlled creativity is genuinely novel and potentially impactful. This perspective shift could influence how the community approaches hallucination in LLMs, moving from pure suppression to strategic utilization. The work addresses an important challenge in AI safety while opening new directions for AI-assisted scientific discovery. However, the actual impact depends heavily on the empirical validation, which appears incomplete.\n\nOriginality:\nThe paper presents a fresh perspective on a well-studied problem. While individual components (novelty metrics, uncertainty estimation, adaptive control) exist in prior work, their integration for controlled hallucination in scientific contexts is novel. The connection to human creativity theories provides theoretical grounding that distinguishes this work from purely technical approaches to hallucination mitigation.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors commit to full reproducibility with code, data, and detailed experimental protocols. The algorithmic descriptions are sufficiently detailed, and the experimental setup is clearly specified. However, since the actual experiments appear to be incomplete or simulated, true reproducibility cannot be fully assessed.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe paper thoughtfully addresses ethical concerns about creative hallucinations potentially misleading users or propagating harmful claims. The proposed safeguards (transparency, human-in-the-loop validation, abstention mechanisms) are appropriate. The limitations discussion is comprehensive, covering dataset bias, expert validation needs, and governance requirements.\n\nCitations and Related Work:\nThe related work section adequately covers relevant literature across hallucination research, creativity theory, and control mechanisms. However, some citations appear to be placeholder or generated (e.g., several arXiv preprints with future dates), which raises concerns about the thoroughness of the literature review.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. The experimental results section lacks actual empirical data - it reads more like a description of expected results rather than completed experiments\n2. Several citations appear to be generated or placeholder references rather than real papers\n3. The human evaluation component is described but not actually conducted\n4. The mathematical domains and biomedical applications are described conceptually but lack concrete instantiation\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some notation inconsistencies (e.g., switching between c and candidate)\n- The AI involvement checklist reveals extensive AI generation of content, which may explain some of the issues with incomplete experiments and placeholder citations\n- Some claims about performance improvements are not substantiated with actual data\n\nThe paper presents a compelling conceptual framework but appears to be more of a research proposal or early-stage work rather than a complete empirical study. While the ideas are valuable and potentially impactful, the lack of concrete experimental validation significantly limits the contribution."

Strengths include a constructive conceptual perspective, clear decomposition of novelty and plausibility, sensible system design, broad domain applicability (math and biomedicine), and explicit attention to ethics and reproducibility. However, the work suffers from under-specified core metrics (especially the definitions and calibration of novelty and plausibility), insufficient detail on adaptive control mechanisms, and a lack of transparency and rigor in evaluation (missing tables, error bars, and baseline comparisons). Editing issues and missing figures/tables further detract from clarity and reproducibility. While the conceptual contribution is appealing and could influence future discourse, the methodological and empirical shortcomings limit confidence in the results and the paper's impact. Actionable suggestions include formalizing metric definitions, detailing adaptive control, strengthening evaluation and baselines, and improving presentation and reproducibility. Overall, the paper is promising but requires significant technical and empirical improvements to meet the standards of a high-impact venue."

        "value": "This work introduces a framework for evaluation of novel research ideas by formulating novelty as a balance between new ideas (those that have not been seen previously) and plausibility (ideas that are feasible to test). It introduces a creative utility score (CUS) that they use to select from candidate proposed solutions generated by LLMs. It then measures these on idea generation in mathematics and biomedicine in controlled task settings. The paper finds that the “adaptive” approach outperforms more static approaches, where the authors iteratively optimize the balance between novelty and plausibility in the CUS to generate interesting hypotheses."

      "strengths_and_weaknesses": {
        "value": "Strengths:\n- This is an impactful problem that the authors motivate very well. As identified, hypothesis generation is indeed a challenging task, and they appropriately treat the problem and its complexity in their motivation.\n- The framing introduced by this paper of hypothesis novelty is interesting and concrete. The authors present a metric that is intuitive and somewhat easy to measure as a score on which to select LLM ideas.\n- The results settings are controlled and provide a useful framework for evaluating the model. The gene ontology setting in particular is interesting and concrete as a task in biomedicine, which can often contain tasks that are difficult to verify.\n- The proposed use of human experts to verify ground-truth novelty is interesting. Much work has been put into novelty evaluation, but no metrics exist that are robust enough to be considered \"ground truth\".\n- The paper is written very clearly, with many of the details of the methods and motivation in particular being laid out in sufficient detail.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- There are several claims that are uncited within the introduction paragraph, and many hand-wavy claims are made about hallucinations being traditionally treated as \"errors\".\n- The idea of harnessing hallucinations for novel hypothesis generation is an interesting one, but nothing in the authors' proposed method seems to be motivated to specifically work on \"hallucinations\". Hallucinations arise when a language model is prompted in unconventional ways, but the authors don't experiment with extreme sampling or trying to push the model to hallucinate. The paper would benefit from an analysis of how the CUS performs on very out-of-distribution ideas.\n- The main weakness of this work is a lack of results. Results are only briefly described in one section, and no figures or presentation of the wider results are included. This makes evaluation of the method very difficult, as the described results could be just cherry-picked interpretations of the full results. It is appreciated that the authors provide their full codebase for reproducibility, but this work needs a proper presentation of results and interpretations of these that is more than one small section."

        "value": "Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are widely regarded as failures that undermine reliability. Yet, in human cognition, speculative ideas that initially lack verification have often served as the seeds of creativity and discovery. This paper advances the hypothesis that hallucinations, when systematically controlled, can be reframed as mechanisms for creative ideation.\nWe introduce the Creative Utility Score (CUS), a novel metric that balances novelty against plausibility, and propose an adaptive agent architecture that dynamically regulates hallucination intensity across exploratory, grounding, and adaptive modes. Our framework operationalizes a creativity-inspired cycle of divergent and convergent reasoning, enabling AI systems to generate bold hypotheses while safeguarding factual accuracy.\nEmpirical evaluations in mathematics and biomedicine demonstrate that adaptive control significantly increases the production of novel and useful conjectures, while preserving verification success and calibration. These findings establish hallucination not as an error to suppress, but as a resource to channel responsibly.\nBy reframing hallucination as creativity with safeguards, this work provides both a theoretical foundation and a practical pathway for AI systems that aspire not only to replicate knowledge, but to expand the frontier of scientific discovery. All code and experiments are openly available at: https://github.com/myai007/AI_Creativity to ensure full reproducibility."

        "value": "This paper presents a novel and compelling perspective on the phenomenon of hallucination in large language models (LLMs). Instead of treating hallucinations as a critical failure to be eliminated, the authors reframe them as a computational analogue of human divergent thinking—a potential source of creativity that, if properly controlled, can fuel scientific discovery. The paper introduces a formal framework to operationalize this idea, consisting of a \"Creative Utility Score\" (CUS) to balance novelty and plausibility, and an adaptive agent architecture that dynamically regulates hallucination intensity. This framework is empirically validated in the domains of mathematical conjecture discovery and biomedical hypothesis generation, demonstrating that the proposed adaptive approach generates more novel, useful, and reliable outputs than baseline methods that are either purely exploratory or purely grounded.\n\n**Quality and Technical Soundness:**\nThe paper is of exceptionally high quality and is technically sound. The conceptual reframing of hallucination is grounded in well-established theories of human creativity, providing a strong theoretical foundation. The proposed Creative Utility Score (CUS) is a simple yet elegant formalization of the trade-off between novelty and plausibility. The definitions of novelty (semantic divergence and corpus uniqueness) and plausibility (verifier-calibrated probability) are sensible and practical. The use of external, domain-specific verifiers (symbolic solvers for math, retrieval-based checkers for biomedicine) is a crucial and well-executed design choice that grounds the system in reality.\n\nThe agent architecture is well-designed, and the adaptive control mechanism, which modulates the trade-off parameter `α` based on uncertainty, is intuitive and effective. The experimental results are strong and directly support the paper's central claims. The reported improvements in metrics like Correctness@20 and Usefulness@20 for the adaptive mode are significant. The inclusion of ablation studies further strengthens the claims by demonstrating the importance of the chosen components, such as the uncertainty-driven controller.\n\n**Clarity:**\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written, clear, and well-organized. The abstract and introduction effectively motivate the problem and summarize the contributions. The narrative flows logically from the high-level concept to the technical details of the framework and the empirical evaluation. The methodology is described with sufficient detail, including pseudo-code, to understand the approach. The results are presented concisely and effectively. The paper is a model of clarity and academic writing.\n\n**Significance and Impact:**\nThe potential impact of this work is profound. It challenges the dominant paradigm of hallucination as a purely negative phenomenon and offers a constructive, practical alternative. By providing a pathway to harness LLM fallibility for creative ideation, this work could unlock a new class of applications for AI in science, repositioning LLMs from mere knowledge retrieval systems to genuine creative partners in the scientific process. The ideas presented are likely to inspire a significant amount of follow-up research on controlled generation, creative AI, and human-AI collaboration. This work has the potential to be a landmark paper in the field of AI for science.\n\n**Originality:**\nThe work is highly original. While the connection between hallucination and creativity may have been noted conceptually before, this paper appears to be the first to develop a comprehensive computational framework to formalize, implement, and validate this idea. The introduction of the CUS metric and the adaptive agent architecture specifically for managing hallucinations as a creative resource is a novel contribution. The entire framing represents a significant departure from the mainstream research on hallucination mitigation.\n\n**Reproducibility:**\nThe authors have demonstrated an exemplary commitment to reproducibility. The paper includes a detailed reproducibility statement promising to release all code, data, prompts, and evaluation scripts. The experimental protocol, system configurations, and statistical methods are clearly described, providing a solid foundation for others to build upon and verify the results.\n\n**Ethics and Limitations:**\nThe authors address the ethical implications of their work with maturity and foresight. They explicitly discuss the risks of generating and disseminating plausible-sounding but false information, especially in high-stakes domains. Their proposed mitigations, including verification, abstention mechanisms, and the clear flagging of speculative outputs, are appropriate and necessary. The discussion of limitations and future directions is thoughtful and provides a clear roadmap for the field.\n\n**Minor Weaknesses:**\nThe paper is nearly flawless, but a few minor points could be clarified. The exact update rule for the `α` parameter in the adaptive controller (i.e., the `increase` and `decrease` functions) is not specified. Similarly, the definition of `cosdist` in the novelty metric could be more precise. However, these are minor details that are likely to be clarified in the supplementary materials and code release and do not detract from the paper's overall excellence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an outstanding paper that is technically strong, highly original, and poised to have a major impact on the field. It presents a paradigm-shifting idea, executes it brilliantly, and validates it with convincing empirical results. The work is presented with exceptional clarity and a deep sense of scientific and ethical responsibility. It is a perfect fit for the Agents4Science conference and represents the very best of what AI-driven scientific research can be. I recommend it for acceptance without any reservations."
