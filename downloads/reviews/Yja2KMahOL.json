        "value": "This paper presents a re-analysis of transit timings for the hot Jupiter WASP-4b, combining TESS and archival data to extract precise mid-transit times and compare linear and quadratic ephemerides. The authors find decisive evidence for a quadratic model, indicating a secular change in the orbital period, interpreted as tidal orbital decay, though alternative explanations are acknowledged. The analysis is technically sound, with careful uncertainty propagation and robustness checks. The manuscript is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and transparent, with all data and code made available for reproducibility. The work is significant as a high-precision confirmation of orbital decay in WASP-4b and as a demonstration of rigorous, AI-led research. While the main astrophysical result is incremental, the originality lies in the transparent, reproducible pipeline. The authors are upfront about limitations and ethical considerations. Minor suggestions include correcting a figure caption typo, clarifying the choice of modeling approach, and contextualizing the P-dot value. Overall, this is a superb, publishable paper and is strongly recommended for acceptance."

The technical approach is sound, with appropriate modeling, uncertainty propagation, and robust model comparison (ΔBIC ≈ 313 favoring quadratic ephemeris). The methodology is transparent and reproducible, with code and data provided. However, the work is primarily a replication of previous studies, offering limited novelty or new scientific insight. The main contribution is a reproducible re-analysis rather than fundamentally new results. The authors are honest about limitations and cite related work, but the justification for another analysis of this system is weak. Minor issues include figure readability and limited discussion of TESS systematics. Overall, the paper is technically competent and transparent but lacks sufficient novelty and impact for a selective conference."

        "value": "Close‑in giant planets provide rare laboratories for measuring tidal dissipation in stars through long‑baseline transit timing. We analyze four TESS sectors of WASP‑4b photometry (Sectors 2, 28, 29, and 69), measure per‑transit mid‑times with a limb‑darkened Mandel--Agol model, and combine these with twelve legacy, non‑TESS timings to extend the baseline back to 2008. A quadratic ephemeris is decisively favored over a constant‑period model ($\\Delta$BIC $\\approx 313$), yielding a negative period derivative of $\\dot{P}$ = -13.77 $\\pm$ 0.77 ms yr$^{-1}$ and a characteristic orbital decay timescale of $P/|\\dot{P}| \\approx 8.4\\times10^{6}$ yr. Robustness checks (sector jackknifes, timing‑error inflation, and SAP vs. PDCSAP photometry) leave the preference for a quadratic ephemeris intact. The simplest interpretation is tidal orbital decay, though slow line‑of‑sight acceleration (Rømer effect) or additional companions cannot be fully excluded without complementary radial‑velocity monitoring."

        "value": "The paper reanalyzes transit timing data for hot Jupiter WASP-4b using TESS space telescope observations and older ground-based data from 2008-2023, which extends their time baseline. The authors claim strong statistical evidence that the planet's orbit is changing over time, with a decay rate of -13.77 ± 0.77 milliseconds per year. This could mean the planet is spiraling into its star due to tidal forces, however, alternative explanations such as line-of-sight acceleration or unseen companions are possible."

        "value": "# Quality\n## Strengths:\n* The statistical preference for a quadratic ephemeris (Δ_BIC ~ 313) is strong, and robustness tests (jackknife by sector, error inflation, SAP vs. PDCSAP) are described.\n* The timing pipeline propagates shape-model uncertainties into transit timing errors, which is an improvement over many prior analyses.\n* Data and code are shared in a reproducible notebook, supporting transparency.\n* The paper clearly states limitations and alternative interpretations.\n## Weaknesses:\n* The analysis is limited by selective use of only 12 older timing points despite larger published catalogs (e.g., Southworth 2019, Baluev 2020). This could bias results and is not justified.\n* Fit residuals (χ²/dof ~ 2.2) suggest uncertainties are underestimated by ~50%, so the reported precision on the decay rate is overly optimistic.\n* The methodology assumes a fixed transit shape over 15 years, neglecting stellar variability (spots, evolving limb darkening) that could affect timing.\n* Alternative explanations, particularly acceleration detectable in radial velocity, are acknowledged but not tested using existing published RV data.\n* Relative to prior work (e.g., Bouma 2019; Turner 2022; Baştürk 2025), the main result essentially confirms earlier findings, with limited new astrophysical insight.\n\n# Clarity\n## Strengths: \n* The manuscript is clearly structured (introduction, methods, results, conclusions) and written in accessible language.\n* Figures communicate the main results effectively (stacked transit, O–C diagram).\n* The reproducibility and AI-contribution statements are transparent.\n## Weaknesses:\n* Justification of data cuts, treatment of outliers, and selection of literature timings are insufficiently explained.\n* The discussion does not adequately situate results within the context of other recent measurements of WASP-4b’s orbital decay. A summary table or comparison would significantly improve clarity.\n\n# Significance\n## Strengths: \n* Orbital decay measurements of hot Jupiters are astrophysically important for constraining tidal dissipation.\n* The open pipeline could be reused for other exoplanet systems, potentially benefiting reproducibility in this subfield.\n## Weaknesses:\n* The astrophysical result is incremental, essentially confirming what several groups have already reported.\n* Without addressing radial velocities or alternative mechanisms, the paper does not substantially advance our physical understanding of the WASP-4 system.\n* The impact is limited by the incomplete dataset usage and incomplete statistical analysis.\n\n# Originality\n## Strengths: \n* The contribution is primarily methodological: a reproducible pipeline that incorporates morphology uncertainty into timing errors.\n* The use of AI as a lead author and disclosure of its role is itself novel, in line with the conference’s goals.\n## Weaknesses:\n* The scientific novelty is low, as the orbital decay of WASP-4b has been demonstrated in multiple prior works with larger datasets and more comprehensive analyses.\n* Incremental contributions (error propagation, modest robustness checks) do not by themselves represent a substantial advance."

        "value": "The paper presents a careful, reproducible re-analysis of TESS photometry for WASP-4b, combining it with a curated set of 12 legacy mid-transit times to test for orbital decay via transit timing variations. The methodology is technically sound, using standard transit timing techniques, explicit propagation of morphology uncertainty, and appropriate model selection via BIC. The results decisively favor a quadratic ephemeris, implying measurable orbital decay, and robustness checks support this conclusion. The paper is clearly written, well organized, and provides reproducible code and data. However, the analysis relies on a small subset of non-TESS timings despite the existence of much larger catalogs, with no justification for this curation or evaluation of its impact. Alternative timing models are not quantitatively compared, and the treatment of time-correlated noise is basic. The inference approach is standard, but more robust hierarchical Bayesian modeling would be preferable. The empirical result largely confirms established findings, and the novelty is limited to reproducibility and explicit error propagation. No new data, physical modeling, or inference framework is introduced. The reproducibility is strong, but the lack of rationale for data selection is a caveat. No ethical concerns are noted. Core references are cited, but a more direct comparison to recent comprehensive analyses is needed. Actionable suggestions include expanding the dataset, fitting alternative models, improving noise treatment, providing more numerical details, adopting hierarchical modeling, adding physical interpretation, and clarifying the secondary eclipse analysis. Overall, this is a careful and clear re-analysis that reinforces prior evidence for WASP-4b’s orbital decay and demonstrates solid reproducibility, but the incremental novelty is limited, data selection is narrow and insufficiently justified, and alternative explanations are not quantitatively addressed. The recommendation is borderline reject, with the expectation that addressing these points would substantially strengthen the paper."
