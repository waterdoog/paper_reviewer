        "value": "This paper presents Multi-Layer Concentration Analysis for enhancing pre-training data detection in large language models. The work is technically sound, building on the Min-K%++ baseline and introducing concentration features (Shannon entropy, Gini coefficient, top-k concentration, effective vocabulary size) from multiple network layers. The mathematical formulations are correct and the experimental methodology is reasonable. However, improvements are modest (especially for Pythia, 0-1 percentage points AUROC), there is no statistical significance testing due to single runs, and the theoretical justification for multi-layer analysis could be stronger. The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear methodology and effective figures, though some technical details (like layer selection and feature aggregation weights) could be clearer. The significance is limited, with incremental improvements and the most notable gains for Mamba (up to 1.9 percentage points). The architectural insights are interesting but not groundbreaking. The originality lies in combining multi-layer analysis with concentration features, but the core ideas are not particularly novel individually. The paper provides sufficient detail for reproduction, though the lack of error bars and single runs limit reproducibility assessment. Ethical considerations are adequately discussed, focusing on data privacy and copyright. The related work section is comprehensive and citations are appropriate. Major concerns include modest improvements, single runs without statistical testing, shallow theoretical understanding, and limited exploration of architectural differences. Minor issues include arbitrary hyperparameter choices, limited computational overhead analysis, and some unsupported claims about architectures. Overall, the paper addresses an important problem and shows consistent if modest improvements, representing an incremental advance rather than a significant breakthrough."

        "value": "The detection of pre-training data in large language models has become crucial for privacy and copyright compliance, yet existing approaches fundamentally misunderstand how neural networks encode memorization patterns. While current methods like Min-K++ focus exclusively on final-layer outputs, they ignore the rich memorization signatures that emerge throughout the network hierarchy—a critical oversight that limits detection accuracy and robustness. We introduce Multi-Layer Concentration Analysis, a comprehensive framework that captures how probability distributions evolve and concentrate across multiple network layers, revealing memorization patterns invisible to single-layer approaches. Our method extracts theoretically-grounded concentration features—Shannon entropy, Gini coefficient, top-k concentration measures, and effective vocabulary size—from strategically selected early, middle, and late layers, then fuses these multi-layer signatures with Min-K++ using adaptive weighting. Extensive evaluation on WikiMIA benchmark across Pythia-2.8b and Mamba-1.4b-hf models demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving up to 70.3% AUROC with 1.9 percentage point gains for state-space models on 128-token sequences. Critically, our analysis uncovers fundamental architectural differences: state-space models like Mamba exhibit distinct multi-layer memorization signatures that can be leveraged for superior detection, while transformers show more modest improvements. This architectural insight opens new directions for detection methodology and provides the first systematic analysis of how different neural architectures encode training data signatures across network depth."

        "value": "This paper proposes \"Multi-Layer Concentration Analysis\" to improve pre-training data detection in large language models by analyzing probability distributions from intermediate layers, hypothesizing that memorization leaves signatures throughout the network. The method is evaluated on WikiMIA using Pythia-2.8b (Transformer) and Mamba-1.4b-hf (State-Space Model), showing consistent improvements for Mamba (up to 1.9 AUROC points), with benefits being architecture-dependent.\n\nStrengths:\n- Novel insight that SSMs like Mamba benefit more from multi-layer analysis than Transformers, suggesting fundamental architectural differences.\n- Well-motivated and technically sound approach, building on strong baselines and using theoretically grounded features.\n- Strong empirical results for Mamba, with clear visualizations and meaningful AUROC improvements.\n- Clear writing, good structure, and a dedicated limitations section.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Critically flawed evaluation for the Transformer (Pythia): the comparison is invalid due to a \"simplified\" analysis for Pythia, lacking transparency and rigor, undermining claims about architectural differences.\n- Inconsistent hyperparameter selection: main results use a suboptimal value, weakening confidence in the findings.\n- Limited robustness: small sample sizes, single runs, and no statistical significance tests make it hard to assess the reliability of the reported gains.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a promising idea and strong results for Mamba, but major experimental flaws—especially regarding the Transformer evaluation and hyperparameter inconsistency—outweigh the reasons to accept. The paper is not ready for publication in its current form, but could be reconsidered if these issues are addressed."

        "value": "The paper introduces Multi-Layer Concentration Analysis (MLCA) to improve pre-training data detection by augmenting Min-K%++ with distribution-shape features computed at multiple layers. While the motivation is clear and the method is described transparently, the review identifies several significant weaknesses: (1) lack of calibration/validation for per-layer distributions, (2) errors and ambiguities in aggregation and normalization formulas, (3) inconsistent application of the method across architectures (multi-layer only for Mamba, not Pythia), (4) modest and mixed empirical gains with insufficient statistical rigor (no confidence intervals, inconsistent reporting), (5) hand-chosen fusion weights without proper justification or cross-validation, (6) limited baselines (only Min-K%++), and (7) incomplete reporting of experimental details and reproducibility. The contribution is seen as incremental, with originality limited by the use of standard features and lack of novel multi-layer probing. The review recommends rejection, suggesting that a revised version addressing calibration, formula correctness, fairer comparisons, stronger baselines, and more rigorous evaluation could be a solid contribution."

(12), page 10).\n- Malformed/garbled weighted harmonic mean equation (Eq. (8), page 4); the intended formula is unclear and not standard.\n- Ambiguity in Min-K%++ normalization (Eq. (1), page 3): likely intended (log p − μ)/σ, but printed form is ambiguous.\n- Undefined scope for min-max normalization (Eq. (9), page 4): min/max computed over what data? Potential for data leakage or inconsistent scaling.\n- Methodological gap: aggregation across token positions for concentration features (Sconc) is not specified, yet token selection ratio is treated as a hyperparameter (Section 6.1, page 7).\n- Mislabeling of \"adaptive weighting\"; α is fixed (Eq. (11), page 5), not adaptively learned or tuned per instance.\n- Confounded architecture comparison: multi-layer analysis applied to Mamba but not to Pythia (page 5), yet architecture-level conclusions are drawn.\n- Inconsistent \"up to\" improvement claims (1.9 pp in abstract/conclusion vs 2.4 pp in Table 1 and Figure 1 caption).\n- No statistical significance analysis or multiple runs; small sample sizes (length-128 has only 250 samples), limiting confidence in reported gains.\n- Under-discussed metric trade-offs: e.g., TPR05 decreases at length 128 for Mamba (Table 1, page 6) despite AUROC/FPR95 gains.\n- Feature weights in Eq. (10) are presented as theoretically motivated without derivation; risk of heuristic overfitting.\n- Computational overhead claim (5–10%, Appendix A.3) lacks profiling evidence and may be optimistic given O(V log V) sorts for multiple layers and tokens.\n- Lack of justification for using LM head on intermediate layers and the comparability/calibration of those distributions across architectures."
