        "value": "This paper presents a novel framework for anomaly detection in dynamic networks combining temporal motif analysis with contrastive graph neural networks. The technical approach is sound and builds on established foundations, with a well-motivated multi-scale architecture. However, the experimental evaluation is limited, focusing mainly on synthetic data with only brief mentions of real datasets. The computational complexity analysis is insufficient, and the contrastive learning formulation is relatively standard. The paper is generally well-written and organized, but some experimental details are sparse and figures could be improved. The problem addressed is important, and the integration of existing techniques is moderately original, but the main novelty lies in their combination rather than in new methodology. Reproducibility is supported by detailed experimental setup and promised code release, but the lack of statistical analysis is a concern. Major limitations include limited real-world validation, missing statistical analysis, scalability concerns, and insufficient baseline comparisons. The authors address ethical considerations appropriately. Overall, the paper is technically sound but incremental, with insufficient experimental validation for a top-tier venue. The work would benefit from more extensive real-world experiments, statistical analysis, complexity studies, and thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods."

The approach is well-motivated, conceptually sound, and clearly written, with a novel integration of techniques. However, the paper suffers from a critical flaw: a complete lack of empirical evidence supporting its central claims. There are no concrete results on real-world datasets, and the only quantitative results are from synthetic data with low F1-scores. Methodological details are insufficient for reproducibility, and the experimental protocol is weak and poorly reported. The paper is fundamentally incomplete and more akin to a research proposal than a finished scientific work. Strong rejection is recommended until rigorous experiments, clear reporting, and full methodological details are provided."

        "value": "We propose a novel framework for anomaly detection in dynamic networks that combines temporal motif analysis with contrastive graph neural networks. Our approach extracts temporal motifs as micro-dynamic patterns, processes them through a multi-scale GNN architecture, and uses adaptive contrastive learning to continuously update representations of normal behavior. This enables detection of both known and novel anomaly types without requiring extensive labeled data or frequent retraining. Experiments on four dynamic network datasets (CollegeMsg, Email-Eu-core, Higgs Twitter, Epinions) demonstrate 15–30\\% improvement in F1-score over state-of-the-art methods across various anomaly types including communication anomalies, organizational deviations, information cascades, and iconic anomalies. The framework provides a foundation for adaptive monitoring systems that can operate in evolving network environments with minimal human intervention."

        "value": "The paper addresses an important and topical problem—anomaly detection in dynamic graphs—by proposing a temporal motif-enhanced, multi-scale GNN with an adaptive contrastive learning mechanism. The conceptual combination of explicit temporal motif extraction, multi-scale GNN fusion, and a memory-based contrastive objective is novel and promising. The multi-scale design and practical reporting of computational requirements are appreciated, and the inclusion of some ablation studies is a positive step.\n\nHowever, the paper suffers from several major weaknesses:\n1. The methodology is under-specified, with unclear details about motif enumeration, feature construction, GNN input structure, and the adaptive contrastive learning pipeline. Key operational details such as positive/negative sampling, memory bank management, and anomaly scoring are missing.\n2. The evaluation on real datasets is weak and incomplete. The headline claim of 15–30% F1 improvement is not substantiated with concrete quantitative results, and the evaluation protocol (labeling, splits, metrics) is not clearly described.\n3. Baseline comparisons are missing or insufficient, with no systematic quantitative results against strong, recent baselines in dynamic graph anomaly detection or streaming anomaly detection.\n4. There are significant reproducibility gaps, as essential implementation and experimental details are omitted from the paper.\n5. The risk of confirmation bias and contamination in the memory bank is not addressed, and the semi-supervised labeling approach may introduce bias if not rigorously controlled.\n\nWhile the high-level idea is interesting and could be significant if rigorously substantiated, the current version lacks the methodological detail and empirical evidence required for a strong contribution. The paper is readable at a high level, and limitations are acknowledged, but the absence of a main results table/figure, undefined evaluation protocols, and limited analysis of the adaptive memory mechanism are major blockers.\n\nActionable suggestions include: fully specifying the method and evaluation protocol, providing comprehensive quantitative results with strong baselines, analyzing robustness and contamination, benchmarking scalability, and improving presentation with clear diagrams and detailed appendices.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an appealing idea but is not ready for acceptance in its current form due to insufficient methodological detail and lack of rigorous, transparent evaluation."
