        "value": "Cross-disciplinary research demands the integration of diverse knowledge domains, where single-model AI systems often struggle to balance creativity and rigor. This paper introduces the Cocktail AI Integration (CAI) Model, a structured 9+1 dual-brain architecture built on GPT-5 via MYGPT, combining human-curated innovation logic with automated reasoning. The system orchestrates nine specialized models (M01–M09) for divergent exploration, with a fusion module (M10) for arbitration and synthesis. Experiments in workflow reconstruction, knowledge flow modeling, and seismic risk forecasting demonstrate measurable performance gains over LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), including 15–25% increases in novelty, 12–18% feasibility gains, and 30% fewer contradictions. Real-world validation across seven external submissions further supports alignment between AI reviewer judgments and expert outcomes. All prompts and test traces are detailed in the appendices to ensure transparency and reproducibility. CAI offers a practical framework for AI-augmented science, simulating structured hypothesis generation, peer-like critique, and synthesis in complex interdisciplinary tasks."

        "value": "The paper introduces a multi-agent, 9+1 “dual-brain” framework (CAI) with nine LLM-driven modules generating hypotheses and a fusion/arbitration model synthesizing outputs. While the architectural idea is sensible and aligns with known practices, the paper lacks critical methodological details, such as how the complementarity matrix is computed, the specifics of the arbitration algorithm, and clear evaluation protocols. The evaluation relies on subjective AI-judged scores without human or gold-standard benchmarks, raising concerns about bias, circularity, and the absence of independent validation. Completeness is undermined by missing details for two of three tests and the lack of human expert studies. The originality is limited, as similar arbitration and debate frameworks exist, and the paper does not rigorously position itself against them. Reproducibility is hampered by missing artifacts, non-public dependencies, and incomplete reporting. While the Responsible AI statement is a positive, the main claims rest on potentially biased AI-as-reviewer judgments. The literature review omits key related work, and there is no empirical comparison with established baselines. Actionable suggestions include redesigning the evaluation with human experts, formalizing algorithms, benchmarking against related methods, improving transparency, and clarifying claims. Overall, despite an appealing concept, the submission is weakened by subjective evaluation, missing details, lack of objective validation, and insufficient distinction from prior work."

While the organizational structure and conceptual ideas are interesting and potentially significant, the paper is fundamentally undermined by a critical flaw: all experiments and results are based on the claimed use of \"GPT-5\", a model that does not exist or is unavailable to the research community. This constitutes a severe breach of scientific integrity, rendering all experimental results fabricated and invalid. Additional weaknesses include a lack of technical detail, vague descriptions of the model components, scientifically unsound evaluation methodology (relying solely on other LLMs, including the non-existent GPT-5, without human expert validation), and complete irreproducibility. Although the core ideas are original, the paper fails to meet scholarly standards due to its reliance on fabricated empirical claims. I strongly recommend rejecting this paper."

        "value": "This paper introduces the Cocktail AI Integration (CAI) Model, a multi-model collaborative framework for cross-disciplinary natural science research. The review evaluates it across several dimensions:\n\nQuality (2/5): The concept is interesting but the paper has significant technical and methodological weaknesses, including poor theoretical justification for the '9+1 dual-brain architecture', flawed experimental design (circular validation), unclear claims about 'GPT-5 via MYGPT', retrofitted statistical validation, and an unvalidated complementarity matrix.\n\nClarity (2/5): The paper is difficult to follow due to inconsistent terminology, overly complex and ineffective figures, verbose descriptions, missing implementation details, and appendices with more marketing than technical content.\n\nSignificance (2/5): The contribution is limited, amounting to sophisticated prompt engineering rather than fundamental innovation, with no substantial comparison to existing methods, narrow evaluation tasks, modest performance improvements, and no validation on real scientific problems.\n\nOriginality (3/5): There is some novelty in the dual-brain metaphor and arbitration mechanisms, but the core concepts are well-established and the 'cocktail' terminology is more marketing than scientific.\n\nReproducibility (1/5): Major concerns due to lack of implementation details, unavailable systems, insufficient experimental procedure description, and no code or prompts provided.\n\nEthics and Limitations (4/5): The paper acknowledges AI limitations, risks, safeguards, and responsible AI practices.\n\nCitations and Related Work (2/5): Weak coverage of related work, missing key references, and superficial engagement with the literature.\n\nOverall Assessment: The paper addresses an important problem but lacks rigor, with flawed validation, limited technical contribution, and insufficient theoretical grounding. The writing and motivation are sound, but the execution does not meet top-tier standards. The paper resembles a technical report on a commercial system more than a scientific contribution, with marketing language detracting from its credibility."
