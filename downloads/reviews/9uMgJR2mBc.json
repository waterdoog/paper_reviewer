        "value": "This paper presents a reliability-weighted ensemble framework that integrates textual domain knowledge with statistical causal discovery methods to achieve calibrated uncertainty estimation. The approach is technically reasonable and addresses a legitimate problem, but there are several concerns:\n\n- The reliability estimation formula lacks theoretical justification.\n- The application of temperature scaling is not well-motivated.\n- Evaluation is limited to a single, small benchmark (Tübingen, 72 pairs), restricting generalizability.\n- The main statistical comparison is non-significant (p=0.387), undermining claims of improvement.\n- There is a lack of comparison with other ensemble or uncertainty quantification methods, and the individual statistical methods perform poorly.\n- The reliability weighting scheme appears ad-hoc and lacks a principled foundation.\n- Extensive AI involvement in the research process raises questions about human oversight.\n\nStrengths include addressing an important problem, comprehensive evaluation metrics, clear presentation, and practical relevance. However, the paper's contributions are somewhat incremental, and the evaluation scope and statistical rigor are insufficient for a top-tier venue. The work would benefit from broader evaluation, stronger baselines, and more rigorous statistical validation. Overall, it makes a reasonable contribution but falls short of the standards expected for a top-tier venue."

        "value": "The paper proposes a calibration-focused, reliability-weighted ensemble that integrates textual domain knowledge from an LLM with six statistical causal discovery methods to improve uncertainty calibration for causal direction on the Tübingen cause–effect pairs. The approach fuses LLM and statistical method outputs using reliability-weighted log-odds and post-hoc temperature scaling, reporting a 59% DECE reduction, modest accuracy improvement, and increased high-confidence coverage. Strengths include the focus on calibration, sensible integration of LLMs and statistical methods, reported calibration gains, and broad evaluation metrics. However, the paper suffers from underspecified methodological details (e.g., how reliability weights and log-odds are computed, temperature scaling protocol), unclear relationship between fusion and consensus steps, unexplained dataset discrepancies, lack of statistical significance for accuracy gains, potential LLM leakage, weak baselines, and missing implementation details. The reliability metric is ad hoc, and the approach is only demonstrated on a single small dataset. The paper motivates the importance of calibration but should discuss risks of over-reliance on textual signals. Related work is covered but lacks recent LLM evaluations and stronger baselines. Overall, the idea is timely and promising, with meaningful calibration gains, but the current submission lacks methodological clarity, rigorous evaluation, and leakage controls. Actionable suggestions include specifying all hyperparameters and calibration protocols, clarifying the ensemble pipeline, justifying dataset choices, adding leakage controls, broadening evaluation, and providing richer calibration analysis. Given these gaps, the recommendation is a borderline reject, with the potential for a strong contribution if these issues are addressed."

        "value": "This paper proposes a novel reliability-weighted ensemble framework that integrates textual domain knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) with multiple statistical causal discovery methods, aiming to produce well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for causal relationships. The approach addresses a key gap in existing methods, which often prioritize accuracy over reliability. Evaluation on the Tübingen benchmark shows a significant reduction in calibration error (by 59%) and improved high-confidence prediction coverage, with a modest accuracy increase over a strong LLM-only baseline.\n\nThe paper is technically sound, methodologically coherent, and presents a thorough experimental evaluation using appropriate metrics (DECE, Brier score) and ablation studies. The main limitation is reliance on a single, relatively small benchmark dataset, though the authors are transparent about this. The paper is exceptionally well-written and organized, with only minor clarity issues regarding the determination of reliability score weights and the role of one pipeline stage.\n\nThe work is highly significant, addressing the need for reliable confidence estimates in causal discovery, especially for high-stakes domains. The originality lies in the calibration-aware reliability-weighting scheme for ensembling, which is a novel contribution. The experimental setup is well-documented, and code/supplementary materials are provided, supporting reproducibility. Ethical considerations and limitations are clearly discussed.\n\nOverall, this is a high-quality, significant, and original contribution that is well-executed and highly relevant to the field. Strongly recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "Abstract:\nCausal discovery from observational data often prioritizes prediction accuracy while neglecting reliable uncertainty estimates, limiting practical decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong causal reasoning capabilities from textual descriptions but rely primarily on pattern recognition rather than principled inference. We propose a reliability-weighted ensemble framework that systematically integrates textual domain knowledge with multiple statistical causal discovery methods to provide well-calibrated confidence estimates for causal relationships. Our method combines LLM-derived evidence with six statistical approaches through reliability weighting, log-odds aggregation, and temperature-scaled calibration. Experiments on 72 Tübingen benchmark pairs demonstrate substantial improvements: accuracy increases from 93.1% to 94.4%, calibration error (DECE) reduces by 59% (0.100→0.041), and high-confidence prediction coverage expands to 66% of pairs. This framework enables principled, uncertainty-aware causal inference, supporting reliable decision-making in scientific and high-stakes applications."
