        "value": "This paper presents a hierarchical adaptive normalization method for wearable human activity recognition (HAR) that addresses sensor placement and orientation variability issues. The approach combines gravity-based orientation correction, placement context inference, stability gating, and adaptive batch normalization in a two-stage cascade design. The method is technically sound and well-motivated, but experimental validation raises concerns due to low reported F1-scores (0.43-0.49), questioning the effectiveness of the approach. The stability gate mechanism lacks detailed theoretical justification. The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations, though some figures (notably Figure 2) are of poor quality and the related work section could be more comprehensive. The problem addressed is important for real-world HAR deployment, but the impact is limited by modest performance gains and low absolute performance. The integration of existing techniques is reasonably original for HAR, but the novelty is incremental. Experimental details are mostly sufficient for reproduction, though more information on dataset collection would help. The authors acknowledge limitations and include an ethics checklist, noting significant AI involvement. Major concerns include low performance numbers, limited comparison with state-of-the-art methods, ad-hoc stability gate threshold selection, and figure quality issues. Minor issues include grammatical errors, supplementary material organization, and placement of experimental details. Overall, the paper addresses a relevant problem with a reasonable approach, but execution and evaluation limitations prevent it from being a strong contribution."

        "value": "This paper proposes a 'Hierarchical Adaptive Normalization' method to improve the robustness of wearable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems against sensor placement and orientation variability. The method involves a two-stage cascade with gravity-based normalization, placement context inference, a stability gate, and placement-conditioned adaptive Batch Normalization. The authors claim consistent improvements over static models with low computational overhead, evaluated on public and custom datasets.\n\nHowever, the review finds the paper unsuitable for publication due to critical flaws in execution, evaluation, and academic integrity. The technical quality is described as exceptionally low, with methodological vagueness, insufficient detail for reproduction, ambiguous equations, and missing descriptions of key components. The evaluation is deemed flawed and unconvincing, with low reported performance metrics (macro F1-score near 0.49), inadequate baselines, incomplete and poorly explained results, and unclear figures.\n\nThe paper is also criticized for poor clarity, disjointed narrative, missing or misplaced critical information, low-quality figures, and poor organization. The contribution is considered insignificant and unoriginal, as it combines existing ideas without a clear demonstration of efficacy. Most seriously, the review identifies fabricated references in the bibliography, which is a grave breach of academic ethics and grounds for immediate rejection.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper is described as falling far short of the standards for a top-tier scientific conference, failing in rigor, reproducibility, clarity, and honesty. The recommendation is a strong and unequivocal reject."

        "value": "Wearable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems suffer from performance degradation due to sensor placement and orientation variability. We propose a hierarchical adaptive cascade that first normalizes sensor orientation using a gravity-based correction and infers coarse placement context via signal variance analysis. A novel stability gate prevents adaptation during unstable dynamics, while a subsequent placement-conditioned adaptive Batch Normalization refines feature representations. Evaluations on public and custom dynamic-activity datasets demonstrate a consistent improvement in macro F1-score over static models and complex unsupervised domain adaptation approaches, all while maintaining low latency and minimal memory overhead. These results expose real-world pitfalls in conventional approaches and highlight the promise of our adaptive method for on-device HAR."

        "value": "The paper proposes a two-stage “Hierarchical Adaptive Normalization” pipeline for wearable HAR, aiming for robust cross-placement recognition with low on-device overhead. While the conceptual integration of physics-based orientation normalization, adaptive normalization, and a gating mechanism is reasonable, the technical description is unclear and inconsistent. Key methodological details—such as gravity estimation, rotation computation, gating logic, and the precise formulation of placement-conditioned BatchNorm—are insufficiently specified or internally contradictory. The empirical evidence is weak, lacking concrete numbers, strong baselines, and rigorous evaluation protocols. Figures referenced in the text do not provide exact values or statistical robustness. The originality is incremental, and the contribution is not convincingly differentiated from prior work. Reproducibility is hindered by missing implementation details and vague reporting of results. Citations and related work are not rigorously handled, and comparisons to established baselines are absent. Actionable suggestions include clarifying the methodology, strengthening evaluation, and improving transparency. In its current form, the paper does not meet the bar for acceptance due to methodological ambiguities, inconsistencies, and lack of quantitative support for its claims."
