      "abstract": {
        "value": "Industrial fault detection systems struggle to differentiate between benign operational drifts (e.g., tool wear, recipe changes) and incipient faults, often adapting to faults as new “normal” states and causing catastrophic failures. This work introduces a hierarchical framework that decouples change detection from change characterization. Upon detecting a drift, the system generates a Multi-Scale Change Signature (MSCS) quantifying geometric and statistical transformations in the primary detector's latent space. An unsupervised Drift Characterization Module (DCM), trained on an Online Normality Baseline (ONB), classifies the signature as benign or a potential fault. Benign drifts are ignored, while potential faults are flagged for review; confirmed benign drifts are added to the ONB for future reference. The framework is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and scalable via a tiered human-in-the-loop system. Experiments on the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset with injected faults and drifts demonstrate the potential to achieve high fault detection rates, reduced false alarms, and efficient adaptation to novel benign changes."

        "value": "This paper proposes a hierarchical framework for industrial time-series fault detection, aiming to distinguish between benign operational drifts and true incipient faults. The core idea is to decouple change detection from change characterization, using a Multi-Scale Change Signature (MSCS) and an unsupervised Drift Characterization Module (DCM), with human-in-the-loop for ambiguous cases. The concept is evaluated on synthetic data and the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) benchmark.\n\nWhile the paper addresses a significant problem and is generally well-written, it suffers from several critical flaws. The main weakness is the lack of substantiation for its claims: there are no quantitative results comparing the proposed method to baselines, and standard metrics are not rigorously benchmarked. The significance of the work is difficult to assess without a demonstration of superior performance. The originality is incremental, and the literature review is deeply flawed, with hallucinated authors and future-dated references, undermining the scholarly foundation. The methodology lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility, with vague descriptions of core components and omitted implementation details. Although the authors are transparent about AI involvement, the paper's flaws are attributed to over-reliance on AI, which failed to provide rigorous validation, accurate citation, and detailed reporting. In conclusion, the paper presents an interesting idea but fails to deliver a convincing scientific contribution due to lack of quantitative results, flawed literature review, and vague methodology. The transparency about AI's role is valuable, but the artifact does not meet publication standards. Strong rejection is recommended."

        "value": "This paper proposes a hierarchical framework for distinguishing between benign operational drifts and incipient faults in industrial time series data, combining a Multi-Scale Change Signature (MSCS) with an unsupervised Drift Characterization Module (DCM) trained on an Online Normality Baseline (ONB). The approach is technically sound and addresses a relevant industrial problem, but there are several concerns. The experimental evaluation is limited mainly to synthetic data and the Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark, and the paper acknowledges significant limitations, such as the persistent challenge of subtle faults that barely shift latent space. The core methodology relies on the assumption that faults induce substantially distinct latent manifolds, which is questionable and undermined by the results, which show only partial successes. The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear methodology and helpful figures. While the problem is industrially relevant, the impact is limited due to the acknowledged challenges and partial results, and the approach is incremental rather than groundbreaking. The combination of multi-scale change signatures with online normality baselines shows some novelty, but the work builds heavily on existing literature. Experimental details are reasonable, and the use of standard benchmarks aids reproducibility. The authors are honest about limitations, dedicating substantial discussion to challenges and failure modes. Major concerns include the flawed assumption about latent manifolds, insufficient experimental validation, the need for frequent human intervention, and persistent pitfalls with subtle faults. Minor issues include unclear figure legends, a related work section that could be improved, and indications of heavy AI involvement. Overall, the paper tackles an important problem with a reasonable approach, but significant challenges remain, limiting practical applicability. The work represents an early-stage exploration rather than a mature solution."

Strengths include clear motivation in a high-impact domain, sensible system decomposition, empirical hints of reduced false alarms, and honest discussion of limitations. However, the empirical evaluation is not rigorous, lacking comprehensive quantitative results, strong baseline comparisons, and statistical analysis. Key technical details (MSCS, DCM, ONB, drift detector) are under-specified, undermining reproducibility. The originality is incremental, with insufficient evidence of novelty over prior work. The significance is potentially high if validated, but current evidence is insufficient for practical reliability. Limitations and ethical considerations are discussed. Actionable suggestions include precise definitions, detailed specifications, improved evaluation, sensitivity analysis, corrected related work, and reproducibility enhancements. Overall, the idea is promising and relevant, but the paper lacks the formalization, methodological detail, and rigorous evaluation required for acceptance at a top venue, reading more like a work-in-progress than a mature contribution."
