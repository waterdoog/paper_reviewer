        "value": "Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a transformative platform for long-read DNA analysis, yet state-of-the-art basecallers rely on opaque deep learning models that limit interpretability and hinder systematic improvement. Here we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating that interpretable, biophysically motivated feature engineering can capture key determinants of nanopore signals with competitive accuracy. Using the ONT R9.4 pore model, we construct single-nucleotide and pairwise interaction features and apply LASSO regularization to identify 50 informative predictors from an initial pool of 420. The resulting linear model reduces mean squared error by 87\\% compared with one-hot encoding and outperforms a two-layer neural network baseline, while providing mechanistic insights into signal modulation at the pore constriction. On synthetic homopolymers, our approach achieves a 96\\% error reduction, though limited sample size prevents strong conclusions. These findings highlight that interpretable models can not only approach the performance of black-box architectures but also elucidate the underlying physics of nanopore sequencing. While current results are restricted to noise-free synthetic data, this work outlines a path toward transparent, auditable, and efficient basecalling frameworks with potential relevance for both research and clinical applications."

        "value": "The paper presents an interpretable, biophysically motivated feature-engineering approach for modeling nanopore current as a function of k-mer sequence, using a synthetic, noise-free ONT R9.4 6-mer pore model. The authors construct single-position and pairwise interaction features, selecting 50 via LASSO, and show that their linear model reduces MSE by 87% compared to a one-hot linear baseline, outperforming a small 2-layer MLP. The work emphasizes interpretability and position-specific effects, especially at position 2, and claims strong performance on homopolymers, though with wide confidence intervals due to small sample size. The authors are transparent about the limitations, noting that results are limited to synthetic data and weak baselines.\n\nStrengths include clarity and transparency in methodology, interpretability of feature weights, efficiency of the linear model, and clear organization of results. However, there are major weaknesses:\n\n1. The task is a forward mapping on a static pore model, not actual basecalling, which involves inverse modeling, temporal data, and decoding. This limits practical significance.\n2. All results are on synthetic, noise-free data with weak baselines. No tests with noise or more realistic baselines are provided, making claims non-generalizable.\n3. There are internal inconsistencies in feature definitions and counts, undermining replicability and confidence.\n4. The homopolymer analysis appears flawed, with implausible counts and unclear definitions.\n5. Related work and citations are mismatched and sometimes irrelevant or misnumbered.\n6. Some claims are overstated relative to the evidence presented.\n\nAssessment by dimension:\n- Quality: Technically coherent core idea, but weakened by inconsistencies and lack of alignment with real basecalling tasks.\n- Clarity: Generally readable, but inconsistencies must be fixed.\n- Significance: Low in current form due to lack of real or noisy data and decoding pipeline.\n- Originality: Moderate; approach is incremental.\n- Reproducibility: Reasonable detail, but inconsistencies and lack of code hinder replication.\n- Ethics: No concerns; limitations well articulated.\n- Citations: Need revision and alignment.\n\nActionable suggestions include correcting methodological inconsistencies, defining homopolymer criteria, adding noise-robustness experiments, providing stronger baselines, moving beyond forward mapping, improving statistical practice, releasing code, revising related work, and toning down rhetoric.\n\nVerdict: The submission only evaluates a simplified, forward regression on synthetic data with internal inconsistencies and a weak baseline. It does not convincingly advance the basecalling problem or establish practical relevance. I recommend rejection at this time; addressing the methodological issues and providing robust evaluations could make the work valuable in the future."

The interpretability angle and biophysical motivation are valuable, and the technical approach is sound. However, the evaluation is limited to synthetic, noise-free data, which severely restricts the practical significance of the results. The baseline comparison is weak, as the models used do not represent production basecallers. The reported improvements (e.g., 87% MSE reduction, 96% error reduction on homopolymers) are based on synthetic data and small sample sizes, making them questionable for real-world scenarios. The methodology is clearly described and limitations are transparently acknowledged, but the lack of validation on real data, limited statistical power, and untested noise robustness are critical flaws. The heavy involvement of AI in the research process is noted, which, combined with the quality limitations, raises further concerns. Overall, this is a proof-of-concept study with severe limitations that undermine its contribution, and substantial additional work is needed for it to be a meaningful research contribution."

        "value": "This paper presents a proof-of-concept study arguing for the use of interpretable, biophysically-motivated feature engineering for nanopore sequencing basecalling, as an alternative to the prevailing \"black-box\" deep learning models. The authors construct a simple linear model using features selected by LASSO regression and evaluate it on a synthetic, noise-free dataset derived from the ONT R9.4 pore model. The results show that this interpretable model significantly outperforms both a simple one-hot encoding baseline and a 2-layer MLP, demonstrating that the underlying signal generation process, devoid of real-world noise and complexities, can be captured effectively by a simple, understandable model.\n\nThis is an exceptional paper that stands out for its clarity, intellectual honesty, and flawless execution within its self-defined scope. While the experiments are confined to a synthetic, \"toy\" problem, the work's value lies in its powerful demonstration of a principle and its potential to redirect research efforts in the field.\n\n**Quality:**\nThe technical quality of the work is outstanding. The methodology is straightforward, appropriate, and rigorously applied. The feature construction is well-motivated by the problem's biophysics, the use of LASSO for feature selection is standard and well-executed, and the experimental evaluation is sound. The paper's greatest strength is its intellectually honest framing. The authors make strong claims but meticulously support them with evidence while simultaneously being extraordinarily transparent about the context and limitations of that evidence. This is a model of scientific integrity.\n\n**Clarity:**\nThe paper is written with exceptional clarity. The structure is logical, the language is precise, and the motivation is compelling. The abstract and introduction perfectly frame the problem, the proposed solution, and the key findings, including the crucial caveats. The methods and experimental setup are described with sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility. The discussion section is particularly noteworthy for its proactive and thorough analysis of the study's limitations, even including a subsection titled \"Addressing Reviewer Concerns.\" This level of clarity and self-awareness is rare and highly commendable.\n\n**Significance:**\nThe potential significance of this work is high. It directly challenges the prevailing assumption that ever-larger and more complex deep learning models are the only path forward for improving nanopore basecalling. By showing that a simple model can perfectly explain the idealized signal, it suggests that the complexity of current models is primarily for handling noise and temporal dynamics, not for deciphering the core sequence-to-signal relationship. This insight could inspire a new wave of research into hybrid models, more robust feature engineering for real-world data, and more efficient basecallers for edge devices. The paper provides a strong foundation and a clear roadmap for others to build upon.\n\n**Originality:**\nWhile the techniques used (linear models, LASSO) are not new, their application to this problem as a direct, interpretable alternative to deep learning basecallers is novel and insightful. The primary contribution is conceptual: it reframes the basecalling problem and demonstrates the power of returning to first principles. It carves out a new and promising niche in a field dominated by large-scale deep learning.\n\n**Reproducibility:**\nThe authors provide extensive details about their dataset (the specific ONT model), feature construction logic, model parameters, and training procedure. An expert in the field could almost certainly reproduce these results based on the information provided in the manuscript.\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe treatment of limitations in this paper is exemplary and sets a new standard for transparency. The authors repeatedly and clearly state that their findings apply only to noise-free, synthetic data and do not translate to real-world applications without significant further research. They explicitly detail the shortcomings of their baselines, the lack of statistical power in their homopolymer analysis, and the numerous complexities of real signal data that their model does not address. This honesty does not weaken the paper; on the contrary, it strengthens the credibility of its claims and makes it a more valuable contribution to the scientific discourse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis paper is a masterclass in how to execute and present a foundational, proof-of-concept study. It is technically flawless, brilliantly written, and intellectually honest to an extent that is seldom seen. It presents a clear, significant, and original idea, validates it within a controlled environment, and thoughtfully discusses the path to broader applicability. This work has the potential to be highly influential and represents exactly the kind of paradigm-challenging research that a top-tier conference should champion. It is an unambiguous strong accept."
