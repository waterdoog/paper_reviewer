        "value": "Agent-based modeling offers a powerful framework for understanding complex systems, from social interactions to ecological networks. In finance, such models are crucial for stress testing, risk assessment, and the development of intelligent trading strategies. However, the fidelity of these simulations is often limited by the simplicity of their agents, which typically operate on fixed, rule-based heuristics. Here we present a novel, high-fidelity financial market simulation environment that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to create adaptive, reasoning-based agents. We augment the well-established ABIDES simulator with a novel Brain-Memory Architecture. This features a core LLM ``Brain'' for complex, real-time decision-making, supported by a persistent memory module that records the outcomes of its past actions. This enables a powerful online learning loop, allowing the agent to adapt its strategy based on immediate feedback within a single simulation run. By ingesting real-world NASDAQ data at the message level and introducing a calibrated population of background traders, we demonstrate that our LLM-enhanced system accurately reproduces key market microstructure phenomena, including price discovery and trade intensity. This work establishes a new paradigm for synthetic financial environments, providing an unprecedented platform to study the emergent dynamics of human-like intelligence in complex, competitive systems and enabling the development of next-generation, explainable AI agents for financial applications."

        "value": "This paper presents a high-fidelity financial market simulation integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ABIDES simulator via a novel Brain-Memory Architecture. The technical approach is well-structured and builds on established frameworks, with a sound separation between strategic decision-making and persistent learning. The use of real NASDAQ data provides empirical grounding, but experimental validation is limited to a single day and stock, raising concerns about generalizability. The paper is generally clear and well-illustrated, though some technical details (LLM prompting, memory retrieval, calibration) are insufficient for full reproducibility. The work is significant and timely, addressing the move from rule-based to adaptive agents, but its impact is limited by narrow validation and lack of comparison with other adaptive approaches. The integration of LLMs in this context is original, and the news-aware intelligence is innovative. Reproducibility is aided by open-source claims and use of standard datasets, but key implementation details are missing. Ethical considerations are acknowledged but not deeply discussed. Related work is well-covered. Major weaknesses include limited validation, lack of statistical testing, missing technical details, insufficient comparison with other methods, and limited discussion of computational costs. Minor issues include figure clarity, algorithm detail, and unspecified parameters. Overall, the approach is interesting and technically sound, but the limited evaluation and missing details prevent it from being a strong contribution. More comprehensive evaluation and documentation are needed."

        "value": "This paper presents a news-aware LLM agent layer with a Brain–Memory architecture in the ABIDES market simulator, aiming to improve market simulation realism and adaptive behavior. The strengths include a timely and ambitious problem, clear architectural decomposition, message-level calibration, integration of news into microstructure, and qualitative visual evidence. However, the paper suffers from major weaknesses: lack of quantitative evaluation and statistical analysis, insufficient ablation studies to isolate causal factors, missing implementation details that hinder reproducibility, overstated claims of online learning, limited experimental scope (single day, single asset, synthetic news only), and underdeveloped discussion of ethical and risk considerations. While the architecture is clearly explained and the integration of LLM-based agents is original in this context, the evidence is too preliminary and qualitative to support strong claims. The paper's reproducibility is inadequate due to missing code, data, and methodological specifics. Actionable suggestions include reporting quantitative metrics, strengthening experimental design with ablations and broader coverage, detailing methods and releasing artifacts, clarifying learning claims, addressing ethics, and resolving inconsistencies. In conclusion, while promising, the work requires substantial improvements in evaluation, rigor, and transparency before it can be recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper presents a novel, high-fidelity financial market simulator that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive, reasoning-based agents. The authors extend the ABIDES simulator with two key innovations: a news-aware LLM layer for translating structured news into trading signals, and a \"Brain-Memory\" architecture for online, within-episode learning. The system is calibrated against real-world NASDAQ data and compared against rule-based and noise trader baselines. Results show that LLM-powered agents realistically react to news and generate more faithful market dynamics. The technical approach is sound, the experimental design is rigorous, and the claims are well-supported. The paper is exceptionally well-written, clear, and well-organized, with sufficient detail for reproducibility. The work is highly original and significant, representing a paradigm shift in agent-based modeling in finance. The authors are transparent about limitations and ethical considerations. Overall, this is an outstanding, groundbreaking contribution that sets a new standard for realism in financial market simulation and is enthusiastically recommended for acceptance."
