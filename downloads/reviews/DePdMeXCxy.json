        "value": "The paper addresses an important and timely question about the susceptibility of LLM-based peer reviewers to superficial, hype-oriented edits in abstracts, and whether requiring evidence can mitigate such manipulation. The experimental setup is simple and results are internally consistent, with clear reporting of limitations and a Responsible AI statement. However, there is a critical methodological flaw in the defence: the evaluation depends on knowledge of baseline scores, making the defence partly tautological and not realistic for new submissions. The sample size is extremely small (n=4), only abstracts are used, and there are no human or cross-model baselines, no counterbalancing, and no multiple runs to assess variance. Key implementation details (model, version, prompts, parameters) are missing, making replication impossible. The attack is limited in scope, and the study does not control for confounds such as prior-knowledge effects. The defence concept is not novel, and the study is primarily a small reproduction of prior work. The paper lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility, and the impact is limited by the minimal scope and methodological issues. Actionable recommendations include redesigning the defence evaluation, expanding the dataset and attack space, reporting full implementation details, and improving presentation. Overall, while the topic is relevant and the writing is clear, the methodological flaws and limited scope mean the contribution is not strong enough for acceptance."

This suggests a computation or reporting error (Section 5; page 5).\n- Defense procedure resets scores to the baseline if explicit evidence is not provided (Section 4.5; page 4), introducing leakage from the baseline and compromising the independence of the defended evaluation.\n- Insufficient reproducibility details for the AI reviewer: model identity/version, prompt text, temperature/seed, system settings, and exact scoring instructions are not provided.\n- Extremely small sample (N=4) with a single reviewer and single prompt; no inter-rater reliability, no multiple runs, no variance estimates; no statistical tests (acknowledged but still limiting).\n- Adversarial edits are described qualitatively; no inclusion of the actual edited texts, per-document character-change percentages, or verification that no factual content changed.\n- Figure 1 is a placeholder; the actual histograms are missing (page 5).\n- Decision thresholds are adopted but not independently justified; selection of abstracts lacks a sampling protocol, risking selection bias.\n- Minor reproducibility gap: one abstract (Transformer) is cited via conference proceedings without providing an arXiv identifier, despite claiming all four are arXiv abstracts."

        "value": "This paper presents a small-scale experimental study on the vulnerability of LLM-based peer reviewers to adversarial attacks using \"hype\" language. The authors show that simple stylistic edits can inflate scores for \"novelty\" and flip borderline papers from reject to accept, and propose a defense: requiring the AI reviewer to anchor its scores with explicit textual evidence. \n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper is exceptionally well-written, logically structured, and clear, with effective tables summarizing findings.\n- The topic is timely and significant, addressing vulnerabilities in AI peer review and proposing practical safeguards.\n- The experimental design, though small, is sound and isolates the effects of the attack and defense mechanism.\n- The authors are transparent about limitations, including small dataset size, use of a single AI reviewer, and lack of statistical analysis.\n- The paper proposes and validates a practical solution (rubric-anchored evidence) that could be implemented in real-world systems.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The experiment's small scale (N=4) limits generalizability.\n- The paper lacks detail on which LLM was used and the exact prompt structure, affecting reproducibility.\n- The attack is simple; future work should explore more sophisticated adversarial strategies.\n\n**Overall:**\nDespite the small scale, this is a high-quality proof-of-concept paper. Its clarity, significance, and constructive solution outweigh the primary limitation. The authors' transparency is exemplary, and the work is well-suited for a conference like Agents4Science. The paper is technically solid, its claims are well-supported within its scope, and it is likely to stimulate important discussion and future research. Recommended for acceptance."

Small stylistic modifications can infuence how Al reviewers score apaper, yet simple defences might mitigate this vulnerability. We present a miniature experimental reproduction of the Review-Overfitting Challenge. Four arXiv abstracts from machine learning were assessed against a six-item rubric. We then performed an Al-style attack by rewriting the abstracts to emphasise novelty with-out altering factual content. Borderline papers flipped from borderline to accept. A rubric-anchored defence eliminated the fips, demonstrating that requiring evi-dence for each criterion improves robustness. Our study underscores the need forcareful prompting and transparency when deploying Al reviewers."

        "value": "This paper presents an experimental study on adversarial attacks in AI peer review, reproducing a simplified version of the \"Review-Overfitting Challenge.\" The authors test how hype-laden language modifications can influence LLM reviewers' scores and evaluate a defense mechanism requiring evidence-based justification.\n\nQuality: The experimental design is technically sound but limited in scope. The authors appropriately selected four diverse ML abstracts from arXiv and applied a systematic six-criterion rubric. The adversarial editing procedure follows established guidelines (Lin et al., 2025) with appropriate constraints (<10% character changes). The rubric-anchored defense is simple but effective. However, the study is severely limited by its small scale (n=4), which prevents meaningful statistical analysis and limits generalizability. The scoring methodology relies on a single AI reviewer with human verification, introducing potential bias.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written and clearly organized. The methodology is described in sufficient detail for understanding, though some aspects could be more precise (e.g., specific prompts used for the AI reviewer). The tables and results presentation are clear, though the promised Figure 1 is only described as \"illustrative.\" The connection to Moravec's paradox provides useful theoretical framing.\n\nSignificance: The work addresses an important and timely problem - the vulnerability of AI peer review systems. The finding that simple hype words can flip borderline decisions is concerning for the field. However, the impact is limited by the small scale and the fact that it essentially confirms findings from Lin et al. (2025) rather than providing substantially new insights. The proposed defense, while effective, is quite basic.\n\nOriginality: The paper explicitly positions itself as a \"reproduction\" of the Review-Overfitting Challenge, so originality is inherently limited. The main novel contribution is the rubric-anchored defense requiring evidence for scores, which is straightforward but useful. The connection to cognitive bias literature and Moravec's paradox provides some theoretical novelty, though these connections are somewhat superficial.\n\nReproducibility: The authors provide reasonable detail for reproduction, including dataset sources, rubric criteria, and attack methodology. The promise to release scripts and data as supplementary material is appropriate. However, some key details are missing, such as the specific prompts used for the AI reviewer and exact implementation of the defense mechanism.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors are commendably transparent about limitations, dedicating an entire section to discussing constraints. The Responsible AI and Reproducibility statements are thorough and appropriate. The work poses minimal ethical risks as it uses public data and aims to improve AI review robustness.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. Scale limitations: With only four abstracts, this is more of a proof-of-concept than a rigorous scientific study. The lack of statistical significance testing severely limits the conclusions.\n2. Limited novelty: The core findings largely confirm existing work rather than providing substantial new insights.\n3. Methodological constraints: Single AI reviewer, fixed prompt, limited attack surface exploration.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Missing actual Figure 1 (only described)\n- Some references appear incomplete or incorrectly formatted\n- The connection to Moravec's paradox, while interesting, is not deeply explored\n\nStrengths:\n- Addresses an important and timely problem\n- Clear experimental design and presentation\n- Honest about limitations\n- Effective simple defense mechanism\n- Good theoretical framing\n\nThe paper makes a reasonable contribution to understanding AI peer review vulnerabilities, but the severe limitations in scale and the confirmatory nature of the findings limit its impact. For a first-of-its-kind conference like Agents4Science, this type of exploratory work might be valuable, but it falls short of the standards expected for top-tier venues."
