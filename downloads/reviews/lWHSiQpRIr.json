        "value": "This paper presents a methodology for analyzing quantum error correction (QEC) in hollow-core fibers (HCFs) using Monte Carlo simulations with a physics-driven error model and bounded-distance decoding (BDD). While the paper addresses a relevant problem in quantum communication, there are several significant concerns that affect its acceptance.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe paper suffers from substantial technical and methodological problems. The physics model relies heavily on \"effective coefficients\" (cR, cF, κeff) that are essentially fitting parameters without proper experimental validation. The authors acknowledge that \"effective coefficients cR, cF, κeff subsume filtering/gating and HCF specifics and require measurement-based calibration\" but then proceed to use arbitrary values (cR = 2.5000e-2, cF = 1.0000e-4, κeff = 0.1) without justification beyond matching \"a representative coexistence point.\" This undermines the claimed physics-based approach.\n\nThe error model combines spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) and four-wave mixing (FWM) effects but treats them in an overly simplified manner. The distributed integral approach, while conceptually sound, lacks experimental validation for HCF systems. The temporal correlation model (MMBP) is reasonable but the choice of parameters (β = 2, symmetric transitions) appears arbitrary.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is extremely dense and difficult to follow. The writing style is overly technical with excessive precision in numerical reporting (e.g., \"1.0000e2 km\", \"6.4000 nm\") that doesn't add scientific value. The methodology section jumps between different aspects without clear logical flow. The extensive code documentation, while potentially useful for reproducibility, clutters the main narrative and should be in supplementary material.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThe work addresses quantum-classical coexistence in HCFs, which is relevant, but the contributions are incremental. The main novelty appears to be applying existing Monte Carlo methods with a specific error model to HCF systems. However, without experimental validation or comparison to real HCF measurements, the practical impact is limited. The security analysis in Section 14 feels disconnected from the main work and lacks depth.\n\nOriginality:\nWhile the specific combination of methods may be new, the individual components (BDD, Gilbert-Elliott channels, distributed noise models) are well-established. The physics model, despite claims of being \"physics-driven,\" relies heavily on fitting parameters that obscure the actual physical understanding.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors make extensive efforts to ensure reproducibility by embedding code and providing detailed parameters. However, the fundamental issue is that the model parameters are not well-justified, so reproducing arbitrary results doesn't add scientific value.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. The physics model lacks experimental validation and relies on poorly justified fitting parameters\n2. No comparison with actual HCF experimental data or field measurements\n3. The security analysis feels forced and disconnected from the core technical work\n4. Excessive technical density without sufficient physical insight\n5. The practical utility is questionable without validated model parameters\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Inconsistent notation and excessive numerical precision\n- Poor figure quality and unclear captions\n- The paper tries to cover too much ground (physics, coding theory, security, implementation)\n- Some claims about \"first-of-its-kind\" methodology are overstated\n\nThe paper demonstrates technical competence but falls short of the standards expected for a top-tier venue. The lack of experimental validation, over-reliance on fitting parameters, and limited practical impact are significant concerns."

        "value": "The paper presents a reproducible, single-file methodology for evaluating CSS threshold decoding under asymmetric, temporally correlated noise in hollow-core fibers (HCFs), with a focus on quantum–classical coexistence. Strengths include a physically motivated distributed-noise model, explicit temporal correlation modeling, careful statistical reporting, and excellent reproducibility. However, major weaknesses are the lack of empirical calibration (notably the ad hoc choice of κeff and cR), questionable modeling of FWM dependence on ∆λ, uncalibrated temporal correlation parameters, abstraction away from realistic decoders, and qualitative-only security/operations sections. The paper is clear and well-structured, but could improve numeric formatting and physical parameter transparency. Its significance is limited by the absence of validation against real data, making it more of a methodology note than a substantive scientific advance. Originality lies in the integration and reproducibility emphasis, though modeling components are standard. The artifact is highly reproducible, and limitations are candidly discussed. Key actionable concerns include calibration/validation, improved FWM modeling, empirical parameter fitting, decoder realism, parameter transparency, sensitivity analyses, and presentation improvements. Overall, the work is a carefully engineered methodology note with important qualitative findings, but its scientific impact is limited by the lack of calibration, questionable modeling choices, and abstraction from practical decoders. With the recommended improvements, it could become a strong resource for HCF coexistence studies."

        "value": "This paper presents a detailed methodology for simulating the performance of quantum error correction (QEC) codes over hollow-core fibers (HCFs) in a quantum-classical coexistence scenario. The authors develop a physics-driven noise model that incorporates distributed noise effects (Spontaneous Raman Scattering and Four-Wave Mixing) along the fiber, a significant improvement over simpler end-power heuristics. The model also includes temporal correlations using a Markov-modulated Bernoulli process (MMBP) to capture bursty error behavior. The performance of a representative CSS code is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations with a simple bounded-distance decoder (BDD). The paper's most remarkable feature is its commitment to reproducibility; it is presented as a \"single-file, reproducible methodology note\" where the simulation code is effectively embedded within the document, allowing for the direct regeneration of all tables, figures, and numerical results.\n\nThe submission is of very high technical quality. The physical model, based on distributed integrals of nonlinear noise sources, is well-motivated and a clear improvement in physical fidelity over simpler models. The use of an MMBP to model burst noise is appropriate and well-justified. The statistical treatment, including the use of Wilson confidence intervals and a large number of Monte Carlo trials (10^6), is rigorous. Claims made in the abstract and introduction are meticulously supported by the extensive experimental results presented in the tables and figures. The authors are commendably transparent about the model's limitations, such as the need for empirical calibration of effective coefficients for any specific hardware platform. The work is a complete and polished piece of research.\n\nWhile the paper is technically dense and assumes significant domain knowledge, it is written with exceptional precision and clarity for its target audience. The organization is logical and easy to follow. The paper's standout feature is its clarity of provenance. By providing the exact command-line invocations for every result and embedding the artifact itself, the authors have removed any ambiguity about how the results were generated. This is an exemplary model of scientific communication for computational work.\n\nThe paper has high significance on two fronts. First, it provides a valuable and well-documented tool for researchers in quantum communications. As HCFs become more prevalent, accurate and open-source models for the complex noise environments they present are crucial for designing robust QEC codes and protocols. The detailed parameter sweeps provide concrete insights into how physical parameters affect logical performance. Second, and perhaps more broadly, the paper's methodological contribution is groundbreaking. The concept of a self-contained, single-file paper that is also a fully executable and verifiable artifact sets a new, and very high, standard for computational science. This approach, if adopted more widely, could significantly enhance the reliability and impact of research in the field. It is particularly well-suited for the Agents4Science conference.\n\nWhile the paper builds on established concepts (nonlinear optics, Gilbert-Elliott channels, CSS codes), its originality lies in the meticulous synthesis of these ideas into a high-fidelity model for a new and important physical platform (HCFs). The primary novelty, however, is the radical approach to publication and reproducibility. I have rarely, if ever, seen a paper that provides this level of end-to-end, verifiable provenance for all its results within a single file. The inclusion of a detailed security analysis, mapping threats to model parameters and proposing mitigations, is also a strong and original contribution that enhances the paper's practical relevance.\n\nThe commitment to reproducibility is the paper's defining feature and is, without exaggeration, perfect. The authors provide a \"Re-run recipe\" (Section 19) that details the exact commands to reproduce every single numerical result and figure. The ability for the artifact to emit the raw coordinates for plots, which are then verifiably used in the paper, is a masterclass in transparent and reproducible research. This goes far beyond simply making code available; it integrates the research product and the research process into a single, verifiable whole.\n\nThe authors have done an excellent job here. Limitations are clearly and honestly discussed in Section 16. The paper also includes a thoughtful security and threat analysis (Section 14), which addresses the broader context and potential applications of the work, demonstrating a mature consideration of its impact. No ethical concerns are present.\n\nThis is an outstanding paper that combines a high-quality technical contribution with a groundbreaking methodological statement on reproducibility. It is technically sound, rigorously evaluated, and highly significant for its field. The work is a perfect fit for the Agents4Science conference, as it exemplifies how computational tools can be rigorously developed and transparently communicated to advance a scientific domain. It is an immediate and enthusiastic recommendation for acceptance."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Incorrect hidden-state autocorrelation (page 3, Section 3.3): for the symmetric transition matrix [[ρ, 1−ρ],[1−ρ, ρ]] the lag-k correlation is (2ρ−1)^k, not ρ^k.\n- Inconsistent treatment of zero-count confidence intervals: Figure 5 caption (page 8) and Table 4 note (page 7) cite CP upper bound 2.9957e−6 for n=1e6, but Table 6 (page 9) reports [0, 3.8416e−6], which is the Wilson upper bound. Clarify and use one method consistently.\n- Use of an ‘effective attenuation mapping’ α = κ_eff α_dB (Section 3.2, page 3) is physically questionable; the physical decay constant should be α_np = (ln 10 / 10) α_dB. Calibration should be moved to c_R/c_F or overlap factors rather than modifying α, which changes length scaling.\n- FWM scaling with separation modeled as linear in ∆λ (Eq. (3) and Table 7 on page 10) is not typical of fiber physics (FWM generally decreases with detuning due to phase mismatch). While FWM is negligible here, the assumed dependence should be justified or bounded in scope.\n- Mixture ‘upper bound’ (Eq. (4) on page 10) is asserted without proof; neglecting within-block transitions does not guarantee an upper bound for all ρ,β. Reframe as a heuristic or provide a formal proof.\n- Minor: Define and justify the diagnostic quantity p_eff Σ (page 5) more precisely, including its relation to p_X, p_Z and β.\n- Minor: Clarify units for P0 (dBm vs. linear) within the integrals; currently c_R implicitly absorbs unit conversions, which hinders interpretability."
