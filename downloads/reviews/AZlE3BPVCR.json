        "value": "This paper investigates whether large language models can engage in quality deliberation by examining how structural norms and attitude certainty affect multi-agent LLM dialogues. While it addresses an interesting and timely question at the intersection of AI capabilities and democratic theory, several significant limitations prevent it from meeting the standards expected for a top-tier conference.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe experimental design is reasonably well-structured with a 2×2 factorial approach (structured vs. unstructured × high vs. low certainty). However, the study suffers from critical methodological limitations:\n\n1. Sample size and generalizability: The study appears to run only one instance per condition, which severely limits the reliability and generalizability of findings. No statistical analysis or confidence intervals are provided.\n\n2. Single topic limitation: Testing only one debate topic (commercial use of AI-generated art) makes it impossible to determine if findings generalize to other deliberative contexts.\n\n3. Model limitations: Using GPT-4o-mini rather than more capable models may underestimate AI deliberative potential, and the authors don't justify this choice or discuss how it affects conclusions.\n\n4. Evaluation subjectivity: The DQI scoring appears to be done manually without inter-rater reliability measures, introducing potential bias in the core evaluation metric.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is generally well-written and clearly structured. The theoretical framework drawing from deliberative democracy is appropriate, and the research questions are well-motivated. The methodology section provides adequate detail for understanding the approach, though some implementation details could be clearer.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nWhile the research question is novel and potentially impactful, the contribution is somewhat limited by the experimental constraints. The finding that structure and certainty affect deliberative quality is interesting but not particularly surprising given existing research on human deliberation. The most significant finding—that LLMs struggle with constructive solution-building—is valuable but could be explored more deeply.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors provide code and implementation details, which is commendable. However, the reliance on a proprietary model (GPT-4o-mini via OpenAI API) and the apparent lack of multiple runs per condition limit reproducibility and robustness.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors are appropriately transparent about limitations, particularly the gap between AI and human deliberation. They acknowledge ethical concerns about potential misuse but could elaborate more on the implications of using AI to simulate democratic processes.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n\n1. Methodological rigor: The single-instance experimental design severely undermines the validity of conclusions. Academic standards require multiple replications to establish reliable patterns.\n\n2. Limited scope: Testing only one topic with one model configuration provides insufficient evidence for the broad claims about AI deliberation capabilities.\n\n3. Missing baselines: No comparison with human deliberation or other AI approaches makes it difficult to assess the significance of findings.\n\n4. Shallow analysis: The discussion of why LLMs fail at constructive politics could be much deeper, potentially involving analysis of the actual dialogue content.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some figures could be clearer (stance flow visualizations are hard to interpret)\n- The related work section could better position the work within the broader AI dialogue literature\n- Some claims in the conclusion seem overstated given the limited evidence\n\nThe paper tackles an important question and demonstrates competent execution within its scope, but the methodological limitations, narrow experimental design, and lack of statistical rigor significantly limit its contribution. For a venue like Agents4Science, which should maintain high standards comparable to top-tier conferences, this work falls short of the required quality threshold."

Strengths include clear research questions, sensible experimental factors, principled use of DQI, useful stance-flow visualizations, and generally clear writing. However, there are major concerns: (1) insufficient experimental rigor (no replication, variance, or sensitivity analysis; single topic/model; unclear DQI annotation protocol), (2) methodological and reporting inconsistencies (rounds discrepancy, insufficient prompt/template details, figure/caption errors, unclear DQI operationalization), (3) limited significance without stronger baselines or human comparisons, and (4) incomplete reproducibility details. Minor issues include speculative references, duplicate citations, and figure/chart improvements. Actionable suggestions are provided for improving experimental design, reporting, evaluation, and reproducibility. Overall, the paper's conceptual framing is strong, but the empirical evidence and reporting are too weak for acceptance at a high-standard venue. Recommendation: Reject."

        "value": "Can large language models (LLMs) deliberate with quality across varying discussion structures? This study investigates this question by examining how structural norms and attitude certainty shape the deliberative quality and belief dynamics of multi-agent LLM dialogues. We implemented a 2×2 factorial design (structured vs. unstructured × high vs. low certainty) in which role-conditioned LLM agents engaged in multi-round debates on the commercial use of AI-generated art. Dialogue transcripts were evaluated using the Deliberative Quality Index (DQI) and stance-flow analysis to capture both static deliberative quality and dynamic belief revision. Results show that structure enhanced civility and coherence, while certainty improved justification and interactivity. The combination of structured interaction and high certainty produced the strongest overall deliberative quality, whereas unstructured low-certainty dialogues consistently underperformed. Across all conditions, however, constructive solution-building remained limited, and LLMs failed to replicate the nuanced facilitative role of human moderators. These findings suggest that while LLMs can approximate key features of deliberation under controlled conditions, further advances—such as memory and planning modules or hybrid human–AI facilitation—are needed to move beyond procedural compliance toward genuinely constructive deliberation."

        "value": "This paper presents a novel and timely investigation into the deliberative capabilities of multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs). By employing a 2x2 factorial design, the authors systematically examine the effects of interaction structure and agent attitude certainty on the quality of AI-to-AI deliberation. The study leverages a well-established framework from political science, the Deliberative Quality Index (DQI), to provide a rigorous and nuanced evaluation. The key findings are that structure enhances civility and coherence, while certainty drives argumentative depth and interactivity. Importantly, the authors also identify a critical limitation: the agents' consistent failure to engage in \"constructive politics,\" or the generation of novel, integrative solutions.\n\nThe submission is of exceptionally high technical quality. The 2x2 experimental design is elegant and perfectly suited to isolating the effects of the chosen variables. The choice of evaluation metrics is a major strength; grounding the analysis in the DQI from deliberative democracy literature lends the work significant credibility and moves beyond simplistic performance metrics. The complementary use of stance-flow analysis provides a valuable qualitative lens on the dialogue dynamics. The claims are well-substantiated by the presented results. Figure 1 provides a clear quantitative summary of the DQI scores, and the subsequent breakdown by dimension is insightful. The stance-flow diagrams in Figures 2-6 effectively visualize the differences in conversational trajectories across conditions. The authors should be commended for their candid and thorough discussion of the work's limitations and ethical implications. They are upfront about the agents' shortcomings, particularly in constructive solution-building and moderation, which is a sign of mature and responsible research.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written and organized. The narrative is clear, logical, and easy to follow, even for readers who may not be experts in both multi-agent systems and deliberative theory. The introduction clearly motivates the problem, the literature review expertly bridges the two relevant fields, and the research questions are explicitly stated. The methods, results, and discussion sections are all models of clarity. The authors provide sufficient detail for an expert to reproduce the work, including the specific model (GPT-4o-mini), framework (Autogen), key parameters (temperature, seed), and a high-level description of the persona prompts. The inclusion of a code snippet in the appendix and the commitment to releasing the full code and data further strengthen the paper's contribution.\n\nThe significance of this work is high. It addresses a fundamental question about the future of AI and its role in complex human social domains. This research opens up a new and exciting avenue for interdisciplinary work between AI and the social sciences/humanities. The findings have direct implications for the development of AI for policy simulation, training tools for negotiation, and understanding the dynamics of online discourse. The paper lays a strong foundation for future research. The identified limitation regarding \"constructive politics\" presents a clear and challenging goal for the agent community. The methodology itself serves as a template that can be extended to different models, topics, and deliberative structures. This work will undoubtedly be cited and built upon.\n\nThe paper is highly original. While prior work has explored multi-agent simulations, this study is novel in its application of a rigorous normative framework from democratic theory to evaluate the *quality* of the interaction. The conceptual framing—moving from \"can agents talk?\" to \"can agents deliberate well?\"—is a crucial and original step forward. The experimental manipulation of both structural and dispositional factors (certainty) within this framework is also a novel contribution.\n\nAs noted previously, the treatment of limitations and ethical considerations is exemplary. The authors thoughtfully discuss the risks of misusing such technology (e.g., manufacturing artificial consensus) and correctly position AI deliberation as a potential complement to, not a substitute for, human democratic practice. This level of reflection is crucial for work in this area and sets a high standard for the field.\n\nThis is an outstanding paper that is a perfect fit for the inaugural Agents4Science conference. It is a paradigm of the kind of research the venue should seek to attract: it is methodologically rigorous, highly original, impactful, and bridges disciplines in a meaningful way. The work is not just a demonstration of a technical capability but a thoughtful, critical evaluation of that capability against established humanistic principles. It represents a significant advance in our understanding of multi-agent LLM systems and their potential societal role. I recommend it for acceptance without reservation."
