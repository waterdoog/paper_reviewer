        "value": "The paper addresses an important and timely topic—capability degradation from iterative training on synthetic data (“digital inbreeding”)—and provides a multi-metric empirical analysis. Strengths include the relevance of the topic, a multi-metric approach, explicit discussion of limitations, and a potentially interesting hypothesis about compensatory diversification. However, the submission suffers from several critical flaws:\n\n1. There is a fundamental inconsistency in the reported “Distinct 2-grams” metric, with values exceeding the mathematically possible range, undermining key claims about diversity and compensation.\n2. The core methodology relies on an unspecified “simulation framework” instead of actual multi-generation model training, with insufficient detail to assess validity or reproducibility. The experimental unit for N=10 is unclear.\n3. The main performance metric (F1) is reported without specifying the underlying tasks, datasets, or annotation schema, making the results uninterpretable and irreproducible.\n4. Claims of practical significance are not supported by transparent statistical analysis, and the unit of analysis is ambiguous.\n5. Some reported trends (e.g., improvement in the “Exclusive” synthetic condition) contradict the narrative and are not explained.\n6. Synthetic data generation and filtering procedures are under-specified and may introduce confounders.\n7. Despite claims of reproducibility, crucial details and an accessible repository are missing.\n8. The claim of “first comprehensive empirical validation” is not convincingly supported given the limitations of the simulation and small sample size.\n\nFigures and visuals do not compensate for these methodological gaps. The review recommends correcting the metric inconsistency, providing full methodological transparency, replacing or complementing the simulation with real multi-generation training, reporting per-benchmark results, and making the code/data fully accessible. As it stands, the paper is not ready for acceptance due to critical methodological and reporting flaws."

        "value": "This paper addresses an important and timely question about \"digital inbreeding\"—the degradation of LLM capabilities when trained iteratively on synthetic data. The experimental design is well-structured with a 3×3 factorial approach comparing control (human data), mixed (50/50), and exclusive (synthetic) conditions across three generations. The methodology is systematic and the multi-dimensional evaluation framework is comprehensive, spanning F1 scores, semantic similarity, sentence length, and diversity metrics. However, there are significant limitations: the N=10 sample size is quite small, the simulation framework may not capture all aspects of real model training, and the three-generation limit may miss longer-term effects.\n\nThe paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear methodology section and well-presented results. The extensive appendix aids reproducibility, though some technical details could be clearer in the main text. The work addresses a critical issue for AI safety, with findings of 4.54% F1 degradation versus 3.43% control improvement and large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 1.42), which are practically significant. The discovery of compensatory effects (increased lexical diversity alongside semantic degradation) is novel and important, though the practical impact is somewhat limited by the simulation-based approach.\n\nThe paper provides the first systematic empirical validation of digital inbreeding effects, with a novel multi-dimensional analysis and an original experimental framework. However, the theoretical foundation builds heavily on existing model collapse theory. Reproducibility is strong, with extensive implementation details and promises of code/data availability. The authors are honest about limitations and discuss broader implications for AI development, with no major ethical concerns. The literature review is comprehensive and situates the work well within existing research.\n\nMajor concerns include the small sample size, simulation framework limitations, restriction to three generations, and focus on a single architecture. Strengths include the first systematic empirical validation of an important theoretical prediction, a well-designed factorial experiment, multi-dimensional analysis revealing novel effects, large effect sizes, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and good reproducibility documentation.\n\nOverall, the paper makes a solid contribution to understanding model collapse in practical scenarios, despite methodological limitations. The findings have clear implications for AI development practices and provide novel insights into degradation mechanisms."

Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals semantic coherence decline (-6.05\\%), structural simplification (-17.8\\% sentence length reduction), and compensatory diversification (+34.3\\% distinct n-gram increase).

        "value": "This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 'digital inbreeding,' the degradation of LLM capabilities when iteratively trained on synthetic data. The authors use a 3x3 factorial experiment over three generations, finding a significant 4.54% F1 score decline in mixed-data conditions versus a 3.43% improvement in the human-only control, for a net effect of 7.97 percentage points. The analysis reveals complex degradation patterns, including semantic coherence decline and structural simplification, partially masked by increased lexical diversity. The paper is the first systematic empirical validation of this phenomenon in realistic mixed-data scenarios, offering a reproducible framework and quantitative baselines for AI safety and data curation.\n\nStrengths include the significance and timeliness of the research question, rigorous experimental design, comprehensive multi-metric evaluation, exceptional clarity and reproducibility, and thorough discussion of limitations. The paper is well-written, with clear figures and tables, and provides open access to all code and data.\n\nWeaknesses include insufficient detail and validation for the simulation framework used instead of full-scale model training, which raises questions about the external validity of the findings. The small sample size (N=10) also limits statistical power and precision, though the authors address this with appropriate statistical methods.\n\nOverall, this is a high-quality, impactful, and well-executed paper that addresses a critical issue in AI development. Its strengths decisively outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a clear contribution likely to be widely cited and built upon."
