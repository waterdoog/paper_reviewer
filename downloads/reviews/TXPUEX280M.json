        "value": "The paper provides a broad narrative review of AI applications in endangered species conservation, covering areas such as habitat conservation, species restoration, policy frameworks, community-based conservation, and monitoring/surveillance technologies. It highlights case studies, ethical and policy considerations, and future directions, with figures summarizing strategy categories and publication trends. Ethical and governance issues are acknowledged, and the topic is timely and significant.\n\nHowever, the review suffers from major methodological weaknesses: the literature collection and analysis methods are generic and inaccurate, lacking transparency and reproducibility (e.g., missing PRISMA flow, search strings, timeframes, and screening procedures). Quantitative claims are unsubstantiated, with figures and tables lacking traceable data or code. Case studies make strong claims without clear citations, and there are internal inconsistencies in reported study counts and percentages. References are inconsistent and sometimes erroneous, and there is no formal comparative evaluation or meta-analysis. The review is broad but not original in methodology or synthesis, and it does not deliver on the promise of an AI-driven literature review pipeline. Editorial issues, such as typos and inconsistent terminology, further detract from clarity.\n\nWhile the manuscript is readable and the ethical discussion is a relative strength, the lack of methodological rigor, evidentiary support, and citation accuracy means it does not meet the standards for a scholarly review. Substantial revision is required, including upgrading to a systematic review, substantiating quantitative claims, fixing inconsistencies, strengthening synthesis, and, if claimed, delivering a concrete AI-driven review pipeline. Recommendation: Reject in its current form."

        "value": "In the era of the ’Great Extinction’ driven by climate change and environmental pollution, developing effective and efficient strategies for the conservation of endangered species has become a critical global challenge. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the automation of analysis of academic literature and ecological monitoring, allowing researchers to allocate more resources to on-the-ground conservation efforts. This study reviews recent applications of AI-based systems in literature review, ecological monitoring, and risk detection, and compares these approaches with traditional conservation methods. Based on this analysis, the study proposes future directions for technological innovation and offers policy recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation."

However, it suffers from critical flaws: fabricated and unverifiable references, lack of methodological rigor and reproducibility, superficial analysis without novel synthesis, and unsubstantiated quantitative claims. While the paper is a valuable experiment in AI-assisted writing and offers a cautionary tale about generative AI's limitations, these issues are fatal for scientific credibility. The recommendation is rejection, with encouragement for a thorough revision addressing these flaws."

The methodology lacks critical details about search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and systematic review protocols, making the review non-reproducible and untrustworthy. Claims of reviewing 295 studies are unsupported, and supplementary tables appear fabricated. Figures and data lack empirical basis and source methodology. The writing is inconsistent, with awkward phrasing and unclear transitions, suggesting heavy AI generation with minimal human editing. The paper does not provide novel insights or meaningful synthesis, and conclusions are generic. There are major technical issues: no systematic review protocol, fabricated data, inaccurate referencing, lack of critical analysis, and an overly broad scope. Ethical concerns are raised by the heavy reliance on AI generation without proper oversight or disclosure until the conclusion. Overall, the paper fails to meet basic standards for academic rigor, systematic methodology, and scholarly contribution, reading more like an AI-generated summary than a peer-reviewed research paper."
