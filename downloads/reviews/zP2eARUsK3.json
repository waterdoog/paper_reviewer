        "value": "Stigmatizing language in mental health discourse contributes to social exclusion, reduced help-seeking, and poorer health outcomes. Yet, detecting such language remains challenging due to its subtle, context-dependent, and overlapping nature. To address this, prior work introduced an expert-annotated corpus of 4,141 text snippets and established strong transformer-based baselines for stigma classification. \nBuilding on this foundation, we make three key advances:\n(1) we fine-tune multiple models and apply explainable AI (XAI) methods to enable transparent interpretation of model behavior;\n(2) we adopt a rigorous evaluation framework with stratified cross-validation and detailed performance metrics, including macro F1 and bootstrap-based confidence intervals; and\n(3) we release a fully reproducible notebook designed for replication by both human researchers and AI agents. Using our agent-based system, we completed both binary (2-class) and multi-class (8-class) stigma classification tasks in under 48 hours, with XAI applied throughout. These contributions go beyond benchmark replication, advancing toward interpretable, trustworthy, and deployable stigma detection systems for clinical, public health, and digital moderation settings. By demonstrating the effectiveness of large language models in identifying nuanced forms of stigma, this work lays the foundation for socially responsible NLP systems that support bias-aware communication across health-related domains. To support community adoption and reproducibility, we have released our full pipeline at:\n\\href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/end-stigma/}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/end-stigma/}."

        "value": "This paper presents work on fine-tuning transformer models for stigma classification in mental health text, with a focus on interpretability through XAI methods. While the topic is important and socially relevant, several significant concerns limit the contribution.\n\nQuality Issues: The technical contribution is limited - this is primarily a straightforward application of existing transformer models to an existing dataset (MHSI). The authors acknowledge building directly on Meng et al. (2025) and achieving \"comparable overall performance\" without meaningful improvements. The experimental setup is reasonable but standard, and the results show expected outcomes (transformers outperform traditional ML). The claim of completing work in \"48 hours\" using AI agents, while interesting, raises questions about rigor and thoroughness.\n\nClarity and Presentation: The paper is generally well-written and organized. However, there are some inconsistencies (e.g., referring to \"classical ML\" in figures when \"traditional ML\" is used throughout the text). The extensive appendices showing AI contributions and system specifications, while transparent, detract from focusing on scientific contributions.\n\nSignificance Concerns: The impact appears limited. The paper doesn't advance beyond existing baselines meaningfully, and the primary novelty seems to be applying SHAP explanations to this specific task. While stigma detection is important, this work doesn't demonstrate clear improvements over prior art or provide novel insights that would substantially benefit the community.\n\nOriginality: The work largely replicates existing approaches on an existing dataset. The addition of interpretability methods (SHAP) is valuable but not novel in the NLP context. The \"48-hour AI agent\" aspect is more of a process innovation than a scientific contribution.\n\nReproducibility: The authors provide good reproducibility information including code release, system specifications, and detailed experimental parameters. This is a strength of the work.\n\nEthical Considerations: The paper adequately addresses ethical implications of stigma detection, including potential misuse and the need for human oversight. The discussion of false positives/negatives and their consequences is appropriate.\n\nMajor Limitations:\n1. Limited technical novelty beyond standard fine-tuning and SHAP application\n2. No clear improvement over existing work on the same dataset\n3. The \"AI agent\" contribution seems more like a workflow optimization than a research advancement\n4. Results are largely confirmatory rather than advancing the field\n5. The focus on completing work quickly may have compromised depth of analysis\n\nMissing Elements:\n- Comparison with other interpretability methods beyond SHAP\n- Analysis of model failures or edge cases\n- Cross-dataset evaluation to assess generalizability\n- More sophisticated approaches to handling class imbalance in the 8-way classification\n\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and is technically sound, it represents an incremental application of existing methods rather than a significant scientific contribution. The emphasis on AI-assisted research process, while interesting, doesn't compensate for the limited technical advancement."

        "value": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on detecting stigmatizing language in mental health narratives using the MHSI dataset. It benchmarks traditional and transformer-based models for binary and multi-class stigma classification, integrates explainable AI (XAI) methods, and transparently demonstrates a research pipeline accelerated by AI agents, reportedly completing core work in under 48 hours.\n\nThe technical quality is high, with rigorous experimental setup, appropriate metrics, and robust statistical assessment. Transformer-based models, especially DeBERTa, significantly outperform baselines. The use of SHAP for interpretability is valuable. However, there is a major discrepancy in the performance comparison to prior work (Meng et al., 2025), which is not clearly explained and undermines technical clarity. The use of GPT-4o for data summary raises questions about human verification.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written and organized, with compelling motivation, clear methods, and informative figures/tables. Its significance lies in addressing stigma in mental health and serving as a landmark case study in AI-driven science, aligning with the conference's core theme.\n\nOriginality is modest in NLP methodology but high in its meta-contribution: transparent, extensive use of AI as a research partner, with detailed disclosure of the AI's role and limitations.\n\nReproducibility is strong, with detailed experimental descriptions and intent to release code. Ethics and limitations are thoughtfully discussed, emphasizing human oversight, potential harms, and the ethical dimensions of AI in research.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a strong, timely, and well-suited paper for the Agents4Science conference. Its significance and originality far outweigh its weaknesses, despite some confusion in performance comparison."

        "value": "This paper benchmarks traditional and transformer-based models for detecting stigmatizing language in mental health narratives using the MHSI dataset, with both binary and 8-way classification tasks. It reports performance with stratified evaluation and bootstrap confidence intervals, and integrates XAI (SHAP/Integrated Gradients) for interpretability. The paper also claims that an agentic pipeline completed most of the research workflow in under 48 hours and releases a reproducible notebook.\n\nStrengths include the relevance and potential impact of the problem, strong empirical results (transformers outperforming baselines with macro-F1 ~0.83 for binary and ~0.76 for 8-class), detailed evaluation with variability estimates, appropriate interpretability analyses, clear presentation, and a commitment to reproducibility.\n\nHowever, there are major concerns:\n1. Methodological inconsistencies and reporting errors, including contradictions in cross-validation vs. holdout usage, malformed confidence intervals in tables, inconsistent model specifications, and unclear data split protocols.\n2. Contradictions in the compute environment reporting, casting doubt on the reproducibility and credibility of the experiments.\n3. Limited novelty, as the methodological stack is standard and the main contribution is careful benchmarking and packaging. There is insufficient analysis depth, with missing per-class metrics, calibration analysis, subgroup fairness analysis, external validation, and XAI robustness checks.\n4. The 'agentic pipeline in 48 hours' claim is not operationalized or quantitatively evaluated.\n\nMinor concerns include missing methodological details for SHAP, lack of explicit human verification for GPT-4o-generated tables, and minor typos/formatting issues.\n\nThe application area is important, and the work could be a useful resource if the results are correct and the pipeline is truly reproducible. However, the current version suffers from substantive inconsistencies and lacks essential analyses, limiting its impact and trustworthiness. The ethics section is thoughtful, but without subgroup analyses, equity claims are not empirically supported. Related work coverage is adequate, but a more rigorous replication of prior work is needed.\n\nActionable suggestions for revision include unifying and documenting the experimental protocol, fixing table errors, providing per-class and calibration metrics, conducting subgroup and external validation analyses, reporting XAI configurations and stability, reconciling compute environment claims, and substantiating the agentic pipeline claim with measurable metrics.\n\nOverall recommendation: Reject (encourage substantial revision and resubmission)."

Mapping requires explicit definition and justification.\n- Inconsistent DeBERTa model specification: Methods cite microsoft/deberta-base (page 4) while Appendix B lists deberta-v3-base (page 11).\n- Contradictory compute details: Main text says training on GPU (page 4), Appendix D shows 'No NVIDIA GPUs detected' (pages 12–13). Clarify the actual training environment.\n- Statistical inference issues: Claims about significance and robustness rely on CI overlap and unspecified 'statistical testing' (page 6). Provide proper paired tests and details.\n- Bootstrap methodology under-specified: Number of replicates, stratification, and paired comparisons not described.\n- Cohort table (Table 2, page 5) appears incorrect/mislabeled: counts exceed the number of unique participants; likely snippet-level counts presented as participant counts and flagged as AI-generated.\n- Split protocol clarity: Mixed descriptions (80/20 for binary vs 60/20/20 for multi-class; CV for traditional; ambiguous for transformers) create confusion. Provide a precise, consistent split and evaluation plan.\n- XAI configuration details missing: SHAP background, sampling parameters, and IG baseline/steps not reported, limiting reproducibility.\n- Minor: Table/notation inconsistencies (macro-F1 vs F1-macro), and lack of per-class metrics for the 8-way task."
