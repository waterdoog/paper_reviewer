        "value": "This paper presents a concise and thought-provoking comparison of variability in biological neural systems and large language models (LLMs) through the lens of information theory. The authors employ a Fermi-style estimation to argue that, despite their vastly different substrates and evolutionary/design histories, both systems appear to operate within a similar regime of calibrated randomness, on the order of O(10^2) bits per behavioral response.\n\nQuality: The paper is technically sound for its stated purpose. The core methodology is a Fermi estimation, a \"back-of-the-envelope\" calculation designed to test plausibility rather than establish a precise empirical fact. The authors execute this perfectly. The information-theoretic calculations are straightforward and the assumptions (e.g., effective vocabulary size for LLMs, bits/spike for neurons) are explicitly stated and grounded in relevant literature. The central claim—that the plausible ranges of variability overlap—is well-supported by this estimation. A standout feature is the authors' intellectual honesty. They consistently use cautious language, emphasize that they are dealing with \"conservative ranges\" and \"order-of-magnitude\" estimates, and are upfront about the limitations of their approach. This transparency significantly strengthens the work.\n\nClarity: The paper is exceptionally well-written. It is a model of clarity and conciseness. The argument is presented in a logical, easy-to-follow manner, progressing from the high-level motivation to the specific calculations and their implications. The figures and table are simple, effective, and directly support the text. The writing is precise, and the authors successfully communicate a nuanced idea without overcomplicating it.\n\nSignificance: The significance of this work is high. While the comparison between AI and biological brains is not new, this paper offers a novel, quantitative angle on a fundamental functional property: stochasticity. By framing the comparison in the common language of information theory, it provides a tangible, testable hypothesis about convergent design principles for intelligent systems. The finding of an overlapping O(10^2) bits/response regime is intriguing and is likely to inspire a new line of empirical research to validate and refine these initial estimates. This is a seed paper that could blossom into a fruitful area of investigation at the intersection of neuroscience, AI, and information theory.\n\nOriginality: The paper is highly original. The specific idea of using a Fermi estimate to quantitatively compare the operational entropy of LLM text generation with the information content of a biological behavioral response is novel. It moves beyond qualitative analogies to a concrete, albeit approximate, quantitative comparison. This reframing of a familiar topic constitutes a significant original contribution.\n\nReproducibility: The work is fully reproducible. The authors provide all necessary formulas, assumptions, and numerical ranges. The LLM-side calculation can be trivially verified, and the biological estimates are tied to specific, cited literature. Furthermore, the authors propose a clear and simple \"Empirical Measurement Plan\" that provides a direct path for other researchers to build upon and ground-truth this work.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors demonstrate exemplary handling of limitations and potential ethical issues. The \"Limitations & Future Work\" section is clear and direct. More impressively, the \"Responsible AI Statement\" proactively addresses the potential for misinterpretation of their findings as a simplistic \"intelligence metric,\" showing a mature and responsible approach to scientific communication. The \"AI Research Autonomy Disclosure\" is also a model of transparency, which is particularly relevant for the Agents4Science conference.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is an outstanding conceptual paper. It is elegant, insightful, and impeccably presented. While it does not contain a deep, data-intensive empirical study, its value lies in its clever framing, its intellectually honest approach, and its potential to catalyze future research. It asks a profound question, provides a plausible and tantalizing first-pass answer, and clearly lays out the next steps for the community. This is precisely the kind of creative, boundary-pushing work that a top-tier conference should champion. It is a flawless example of a short scientific paper with groundbreaking conceptual impact."

        "value": "This paper proposes a Fermi-style, information-theoretic comparison of variability in biological nervous systems and large language models (LLMs), focusing on the overlap in plausible 'bits per response' ranges. The strengths include clear problem framing, appropriate use of information theory, and transparent discussion of limitations. However, the work is almost entirely conceptual, lacking empirical analysis, with synthetic figures and coarse estimation methods on both the LLM and biological sides. The overlap conclusion is based on broad intervals and arbitrary choices, and no formal theory connects the analogies drawn. The writing is clear and well-organized, but the claims lack precision and reproducibility due to the absence of actual measurements. The significance is limited, as the main idea is not new and no new data or theory is provided. The originality lies in the attempt to place both domains on a single axis, but this is not sufficiently developed. The proposed measurement plan is minimal and not reproducible, and no code or datasets are provided. The paper responsibly discusses limitations and ethics, but the citations could be improved. Actionable suggestions include conducting real entropy measurements, using concrete biological datasets, developing a normative theoretical bridge, and releasing code and data. Overall, the contribution is too conceptual and oversimplified, with no empirical validation. The recommendation is rejection, with the suggestion that substantive empirical work and a tighter theoretical bridge could make a revised version competitive as a short empirical-methods note or workshop paper."

        "value": "This paper presents a Fermi-style estimation comparing information-theoretic measures of variability between biological neural systems and large language models (LLMs). While the topic is interesting and the approach is appropriately modest in its claims, the work has several significant limitations that prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\nQuality Assessment:\nThe technical approach is sound but quite simplistic. The authors use basic information theory to estimate bits/token for LLMs (3-4 bits/token) and bits/behavioral-response for biological systems (5-300 bits). However, the calculations are extremely rough order-of-magnitude estimates with wide uncertainty ranges. The LLM calculations assume effective vocabulary sizes of 8-16 tokens under nucleus sampling, which is a reasonable but unvalidated approximation. The biological estimates are even more speculative, aggregating across vastly different systems and tasks.\n\nThe work lacks any empirical validation - the \"synthetic baseline\" figures appear to be illustrative rather than based on actual measurements. The proposed measurement plan is mentioned but not executed, leaving the core claims untested.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is clearly written and well-organized. The authors are appropriately cautious about their claims, repeatedly emphasizing that they seek overlapping ranges rather than precise constants. The figures are helpful in visualizing the proposed overlaps, though they appear to be mock-ups rather than real data.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThe significance is limited. While connecting biological and artificial intelligence through information theory is conceptually appealing, the analysis provides little new insight. The conclusion that both systems operate in \"overlapping ranges near O(10²⁵) bits/response\" is too vague to be actionable for either neuroscience or AI research. The ranges are so broad (spanning 1-2 orders of magnitude) that the overlap is almost trivial.\n\nOriginality:\nThe specific comparison framework is novel, but the underlying ideas are well-established. Information-theoretic analyses of neural coding and LLM sampling are both mature areas. The contribution is primarily in the cross-domain comparison, but the analysis is too superficial to provide meaningful insights.\n\nReproducibility:\nWhile the authors provide formulas and assumptions, the lack of empirical data makes reproduction difficult. The biological estimates rely on literature synthesis with unspecified selection criteria. The LLM estimates could be computed, but the paper doesn't provide the actual calculations.\n\nMajor Limitations:\n1. No empirical validation of the core estimates\n2. Extremely wide uncertainty ranges that make conclusions uninformative\n3. Oversimplified treatment of complex biological and computational systems\n4. Limited theoretical depth - mostly back-of-envelope calculations\n5. No clear implications for either field\n\nEthics and Responsible AI:\nThe authors appropriately address potential misuse of a \"variability score\" and include transparency about AI involvement in the research. The ethical considerations are adequately handled.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some references appear incomplete or improperly formatted\n- The biological estimates aggregate across very different systems without sufficient justification\n- The measurement plan is mentioned but not implemented\n\nOverall Assessment:\nThis is an interesting idea that could potentially develop into meaningful research, but in its current form, it represents preliminary work that lacks the depth, rigor, and empirical grounding expected for a major conference. The analysis is too speculative and the conclusions too vague to significantly advance either computational neuroscience or AI research."
