        "value": "This paper presents QLSynth, a reinforcement learning framework for automated quantum circuit synthesis. While it addresses an important problem in quantum computing, the paper has several critical weaknesses that prevent it from meeting the standards expected for a high-quality venue.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe technical content lacks rigor and detail. The RL formulation is superficial - the MDP components (state, action, reward) are vaguely defined without mathematical precision. The constraint U_final ≈ U_target is informal and lacks specifications for what \"≈\" means quantitatively. The paper claims to use \"transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture\" and \"hardware simulator\" but provides no architectural details, hyperparameters, or implementation specifics. The experimental results show suspiciously round improvements (30-40% across all metrics) without error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance testing.\n\nClarity and Reproducibility:\nThe paper severely lacks implementation details necessary for reproduction. Critical information is missing including: network architectures, training procedures, hyperparameters, specific RL algorithms used (PPO, A3C, etc.), reward function formulations, and how quantum circuit equivalence is verified. The experimental setup mentions \"IBM Quantum Experience and Rigetti Aspen backends\" but doesn't specify which specific devices, noise models, or simulation parameters were used.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nWhile quantum circuit synthesis is an important problem, the paper doesn't adequately differentiate from existing work. The related work section is superficial with only 5 references, missing key works in quantum compilation and optimization. The claimed \"paradigm shift\" and \"groundbreaking\" nature is not supported by the evidence presented.\n\nExperimental Evaluation:\nThe experiments are limited to toy examples (3-8 qubit circuits) which don't demonstrate scalability to practical quantum algorithms. The baselines are not clearly specified - what are these \"traditional synthesis tools\"? The comparison lacks important recent quantum compilation tools like Qiskit's transpiler, tket, or Cirq optimizers. The table shows identical improvements across different algorithms, which seems implausible.\n\nTechnical Soundness:\nSeveral technical claims are questionable. The paper doesn't address how the RL agent ensures quantum circuit correctness beyond high-level \"verification constraints.\" There's no discussion of how the approach handles the exponential complexity of quantum state spaces or scales beyond small circuits.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe writing quality is adequate but the paper reads more like a high-level overview than a technical contribution. The references are sparse and some appear to be incorrectly cited (reference [2] seems unrelated to the claimed content).\n\nStrengths:\nThe problem is important and RL for quantum circuit synthesis could be valuable if properly executed. The high-level motivation is sound.\n\nOverall, this paper presents an interesting idea but lacks the technical rigor, experimental validation, and reproducibility required for acceptance at a competitive venue. The authors need to provide substantially more technical detail, conduct more comprehensive experiments with proper baselines, and demonstrate scalability beyond toy examples."

Our approach achieves 30-50% reduction in gate count and 40% lower circuit depth compared to state-of-the-art synthesis tools while maintaining >99% fidelity. We demonstrate efficacy across quantum Fourier transform, Grover's search, and Shor's factoring algorithms, showing adaptability to different qubit topologies and noise profiles.

        "value": "The paper addresses an important and timely problem—automated, hardware-aware quantum circuit synthesis—by proposing QLSynth, a reinforcement learning framework that models circuit synthesis as a sequential decision process. The claimed results are promising, with significant reductions in gate count and depth and high fidelity across several quantum algorithms and hardware backends. However, the submission suffers from major shortcomings:\n\n- The technical formulation is plausible but lacks crucial details, especially regarding the state representation, equivalence checking, and scalability to larger circuits.\n- The RL methodology is insufficiently specified: network architectures, RL algorithms, loss functions, and training details are omitted, making it impossible to assess reproducibility or stability.\n- Hardware modeling is vague, with no specifics on noise models, parameter sources, or how hardware constraints are encoded. The claim of adaptation to new topologies without retraining is unsubstantiated.\n- Experimental results are weak: baselines are unnamed, only small instances are shown, and there is no statistical rigor or clarity on whether results are from simulation or real hardware. Device details and hardware metrics are missing, and some claims (e.g., Shor 8-bit) are ambiguous or inconsistent.\n- The manuscript omits critical implementation details, lacks pseudocode or algorithmic workflow, and does not specify the action space or experimental conditions.\n- The significance of the results is unproven due to the lack of strong baselines and convincing hardware experiments. The originality is questionable as prior RL-based approaches are not discussed, and the reference list is sparse.\n- Reproducibility is currently very weak, with missing details on gate sets, device targets, RL hyperparameters, and code.\n- The literature review is inadequate, and related work is not properly cited or compared.\n\nActionable feedback includes: providing precise methodological details, naming and configuring baselines, reporting robust statistics, clarifying hardware experiments, demonstrating claimed generalization, releasing code, and expanding the literature review.\n\nOverall, while the topic and high-level idea are promising, the paper lacks the methodological rigor, experimental evidence, and positioning required for acceptance. I recommend rejection, with a path to a strong resubmission if the substantial issues are addressed."
