        "value": "This paper presents a multi-agent LLM framework for de novo protein sequence design and structure-oriented ranking. The authors use cooperative GPT-4o agents to generate protein segments in parallel, followed by biophysical filtering and AlphaFold2 evaluation.\n\nQuality (Technical Soundness):\nThe paper is technically sound but limited in scope. The multi-agent approach is straightforward - dividing sequence generation among multiple LLM agents and then polishing the concatenated result. The biophysical scoring function (Equation 1) is reasonable but heuristic. The experimental setup is adequate for a proof-of-concept study with 100 generated sequences. However, the results are modest - only 1 candidate achieved pLDDT > 60 and 2 achieved pDockQ > 0.5, which are below confident folding thresholds. The authors are honest about these limitations.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is well-written and clearly structured. The methodology is described with sufficient detail, including specific parameters, costs (~$5 USD), and runtime (~20 minutes). The figures effectively illustrate the pipeline and results. The writing is accessible and the experimental setup is reproducible.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThe significance is limited. While the multi-agent approach is novel for protein design, the results don't demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods. The generated proteins show only weak structural signals, and no functional validation is provided. The main contribution is showing that LLMs can generate sequences with non-random structural potential, but this has limited immediate impact for the protein design community.\n\nOriginality:\nThe multi-agent LLM architecture for protein design appears novel, and the combination with biophysical pre-screening is reasonable. However, the core insight that LLMs can generate plausible protein sequences has been established in prior work (ESM, ProGen, etc.). The modular approach provides some advantage for parallelization and interpretability.\n\nReproducibility:\nExcellent reproducibility. The authors provide detailed parameters, costs, runtime information, and promise to release code and data. The use of standard tools (BioPython, AlphaFold2) and clear documentation supports reproduction.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors adequately address limitations in Section 6.3, acknowledging low structural confidence scores, heuristic scoring, and lack of functional validation. The broader impact section appropriately discusses both benefits and risks of de novo protein generation, recommending safety controls.\n\nCitations and Related Work:\nThe related work section appropriately cites relevant protein design methods, LLMs for biology, and structure prediction work. The positioning relative to existing approaches is clear.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. Limited novelty - the multi-agent approach is incremental over existing LLM-based protein generation\n2. Weak results - most sequences receive \"Very Low\" AlphaFold confidence scores\n3. No comparison to existing protein design methods or baselines\n4. No functional validation or experimental verification\n5. The scoring function is purely heuristic without validation\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Figure 3 caption refers to \"100 generated protein sequences\" but the figure shows a histogram without clear labeling\n- Some references to sections are incorrect (e.g., \"Section ??\" on line 182)\n\nThis work represents a reasonable proof-of-concept for multi-agent protein design but lacks the impact and rigor expected for a top-tier venue. The results are too preliminary and the improvements over existing methods are not convincingly demonstrated."

        "value": "We present a modular, multi-agent generative framework for de novo protein sequence design and prioritization, developed and executed primarily by autonomous AI agents. The system uses cooperative large language models (LLMs) to synthesize amino acid segments in parallel, with each agent responsible for a subsequence. A downstream aggregation and refinement stage produces complete sequences, which are then filtered and ranked using interpretable biophysical heuristics. We generate 100 proteins using this workflow and evaluate their plausibility through property distributions, unsupervised clustering, and AlphaFold2-based structural prediction. Despite operating without evolutionary templates or functional labels, several top-ranked candidates display moderate structural confidence (mean pLDDT > 60, pDockQ > 0.5), suggesting that LLMs encode useful compositional priors. Our results support the use of agentic LLM architectures, paired with lightweight scoring and minimal human intervention, as a scalable strategy for upstream protein design pipelines."

        "value": "This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for de novo protein sequence design. The system divides the generation task among several cooperative LLM agents, each responsible for a protein segment, with a final 'polisher' agent assembling the segments. Sequences are filtered and ranked using a heuristic biophysical scoring function, and top candidates are evaluated with AlphaFold2. The authors demonstrate the pipeline by generating 100 sequences, finding a few with weak but non-random structural signals. Notably, the entire research process was primarily conducted by an autonomous AI agent (GPT-4o), with minimal human intervention.\n\nThe paper is highly original and significant, especially in its demonstration of an agent-based scientific workflow, aligning well with the Agents4Science conference theme. The technical approach is conceptually sound, particularly the use of a scalable, low-cost front-end for expensive structure prediction. The multi-agent decomposition is a novel and modular approach.\n\nHowever, there are two main technical weaknesses: (1) the biophysical scoring function is ad-hoc and lacks justification or comparison to alternatives, making the ranking process seem arbitrary; (2) the evaluation is small-scale and weak, with only 100 sequences generated and 10 analyzed, and the structural metrics are not strong enough to support some of the claims made.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally clear, well-organized, and transparent, with detailed methods and effective figures. The significance lies more in the workflow demonstration than in protein design advances. The originality is high, both in the multi-agent approach and the near-complete automation of the research process. Reproducibility is good, with detailed experimental setup and a promise to release code and data. The discussion of limitations and ethical considerations is exemplary.\n\nConstructive feedback includes: (1) justifying the scoring function and comparing it to alternatives; (2) including a baseline comparison to a single-agent approach; and (3) tempering claims about structural confidence to better reflect the data.\n\nIn conclusion, despite empirical and methodological weaknesses, the paper's originality, clarity, and relevance make it a valuable and thought-provoking contribution, serving as a well-executed proof-of-concept for AI-driven scientific discovery."

While the pipeline is clear, modular, and cost-effective, the review raises several major concerns: (1) the multi-agent claim is unsupported due to lack of baselines or ablations; (2) structural evaluation is flawed, notably by misusing pDockQ for monomeric predictions; (3) the heuristic scoring function is inconsistent and ad hoc; (4) analysis is limited and lacks controls or novelty screening; (5) results are modest and overinterpreted; (6) reproducibility is hampered by reliance on closed tools and browser automation. The review notes some strengths, such as transparency, ethical considerations, and inclusion of reproducibility details, but finds the scientific impact low due to weak empirical gains and lack of rigorous comparisons. Actionable suggestions include adding baselines, correcting evaluation metrics, improving scoring, implementing safety checks, scaling up experiments, and technical polishing. The verdict is to reject, with encouragement to resubmit after substantial methodological improvements."
