        "value": "The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for automatic scientific diagram generation, evaluating 2,177+ synthetic plots, six methods, and seven metrics. It highlights the 'chart barrier'—a gap between code correctness and visual similarity—and finds that a vision-language fusion approach outperforms others. The work is supported by ablation studies, error analysis, and visual figures, with appendices summarizing results.\n\nStrengths include the importance and scope of the problem, multi-dimensional evaluation, insightful ablations, and honest discussion of limitations. However, there are major concerns:\n\n1. Methodological inconsistencies: Dataset composition is unclear, aggregate scores are not rigorously defined, compute statistics are implausible, and statistical reporting is misaligned.\n2. Evaluation limitations: Heavy reliance on SSIM for visual similarity without human validation, use of only synthetic data, and exclusion of foundation models undermine the conclusions.\n3. Baseline selection: Baselines appear to be author-implemented and not tied to established systems, raising concerns about external validity. Related work is missing recent advances.\n4. Internal coherence: The manuscript contains truncated sentences, numerical inconsistencies, and editorial issues.\n\nDimension-by-dimension, the paper is technically mixed (quality), generally readable but missing critical details (clarity), addresses an important problem but is limited by its methodology (significance), is moderately original, promises reproducibility but lacks details, is thoughtful on ethics, and is only partially adequate in citations.\n\nActionable suggestions include clarifying aggregate score computation, improving metric validity, including foundation model evaluations, clarifying baselines, correcting compute claims, and providing more granular performance reporting.\n\nVerdict: The topic is timely and the 'chart barrier' concept is potentially influential, but due to methodological inconsistencies, questionable reporting, overreliance on SSIM, and lack of strong baseline comparisons, the paper is not recommended for acceptance at this time."

        "value": "This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of automatic scientific diagram generation methods, establishing what the authors term a \"chart barrier\" - a fundamental disconnect between code correctness and visual similarity. The paper is technically sound with rigorous statistical methodology and a comprehensive experimental design, evaluating 6 methods across 2,177+ synthetic diagrams with 7 evaluation metrics. The identification of the \"chart barrier\" (75% performance gap between code correctness and visual similarity) is a valuable empirical finding supported by systematic failure analysis. However, significant methodological limitations affect the quality, including exclusive reliance on synthetic data, exclusion of state-of-the-art foundation models, potential inadequacy of the SSIM-based visual similarity metric, and limited baseline diversity. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides sufficient methodological detail for reproduction. The work addresses an important problem and provides valuable insights, but its significance is limited by synthetic-only evaluation and exclusion of foundation models. The originality is strong, being the first comprehensive benchmark in this area, and reproducibility is well-supported. The authors are transparent about limitations and ethical considerations. Related work is adequately covered, though some recent work may be missing. Overall, this is a solid empirical study with valuable contributions, but its practical impact is limited by methodological constraints. It represents good science and is a reasonable contribution for a conference like Agents4Science, though not groundbreaking."

        "value": "Automatic scientific diagram generation represents a critical bottleneck in modern research communication, where scientists spend 15-20\\% of their time creating visualizations. We present the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating six state-of-the-art methods across 2,177+ synthetic scientific diagrams spanning Physics, Biology, Economics, and Computer Science domains. Our evaluation framework introduces seven complementary metrics assessing visual similarity, code correctness, semantic accuracy, and execution success. Results reveal a clear performance hierarchy: ChartCoder (vision-language fusion, 0.89±0.05) significantly outperforms METAL (meta-learning, 0.85±0.06) and MatPlotAgent (multi-agent, 0.72±0.08), with all pairwise comparisons statistically significant (p$<$0.001). However, we identify a fundamental \\emph{chart barrier}: despite reasonable code correctness (0.52±0.20), all methods fail dramatically at visual similarity (0.127±0.089)—a 75\\% performance gap that prevents practical deployment. Critical findings include: (1) universal 44.9\\% performance degradation from simple to complex visualizations, (2) code generation as the most critical component (41.3\\% importance), and (3) visual similarity errors dominating failure modes (35\\% of all errors). This work establishes rigorous evaluation standards, identifies the primary bottleneck in automatic diagram generation, and provides open-source infrastructure for accelerating progress toward practical scientific visualization assistance."
