        "value": "The paper introduces QISK, a quantum-inspired streaming kernel framework for robust binary classification under concept drift, integrating several advanced components. The motivation for worst-case robustness is clear, and the engineering of the pipeline is reasonable, with strong reproducibility intent and a candid limitations section. However, there are major concerns: (1) a mismatch between claims and methods, with missing details on the kernel and drift detection ensembles and density ratio estimation; (2) a non-standard evaluation protocol that weakens the streaming claims and uses simulated rather than empirical time-series; (3) internal inconsistencies in reporting and ablation results; (4) limited novelty, as the kernel is a separable trigonometric form and the system recombines established techniques under a quantum-inspired framing without demonstrating unique advantages; (5) incomplete and potentially unfair baselines; (6) reproducibility gaps due to insufficient method descriptions and reporting inconsistencies. While the described pipeline components are technically sound, the central claimed innovations are underspecified or unimplemented, and the evaluation protocol is flawed. The writing is generally clear but undermined by conflicts and missing details. The reported gains would be interesting if validated under standard protocols and with all components implemented, but as it stands, the impact is limited. The originality is low, and reproducibility is impeded. The ethics and limitations statements are appreciated, but related work coverage is incomplete. Actionable suggestions are provided to address these issues. Given the methodological gaps, non-standard evaluation, and inconsistencies, I cannot recommend acceptance. Overall recommendation: Reject."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Claim–method mismatch: The paper claims a kernel ensemble (Pauli-X/Y/Z with adaptive KTA weighting) and an ensemble drift detection mechanism (KS, Wasserstein, error-rate), plus multiple density ratio estimators. Methods only detail a single RY product-state kernel and a logistic discriminator; no ensemble construction, combination rules, thresholds, or integration into training are provided (pages 1–2 vs. Section 2).\n- Worst-window objective (min_θ max_t L) is stated (page 2, lines 65–66) but not optimized in practice; the procedure is per-window WKTA+SVM with no min–max training.\n- Statistical inconsistencies: 5 seeds vs. 10 seeds contradiction (page 3 lines 111–113 vs. page 4 lines 116–120); p-values reported without clear test specification beyond t-test; effect sizes misstated (e.g., 13.8% vs. ~13.0% from Table 2; '50–80% relative increase' is unsupported).\n- Metric inconsistency: The text says primary metric is worst-window balanced accuracy (page 3, lines 114–115), but Table 2 reports 'Worst Acc' and figures label 'Accuracy' (page 5). Ablations use balanced accuracy (page 4), impeding direct comparison.\n- Weighted KTA objective (Eq. 6) is underspecified: unclear weighting/centering operators for K and Y, and the double multiplication by W around a 'weighted-centered' kernel is ambiguous.\n- Undefined 'kernel fidelity' used in complexity/ablation claims (pages 3–4): no formal definition or measurement procedure provided.\n- Figure 2 (page 5) shows simulated time series derived from aggregate differences, not actual per-window measurements; this can be misleading in a streaming context.\n- Evaluation protocol does not clarify whether ratio estimators, drift detection, and anchor selection use only training data within each window (potential leakage).\n- EMA smoothing (Table 1) is listed but not described in Methods—role and placement in the pipeline are unclear.\n- Complexity of SVM training likely optimistic (O(n^2)) without discussion of worst-case behavior; could be higher depending on solver and C."

        "value": "This paper presents QISK (Quantum-Inspired Streaming Kernels), a framework for binary classification under concept drift that combines quantum-inspired kernels, drift detection, and importance weighting. The technical approach is sound but raises concerns about novelty and depth, as the quantum-inspired kernel is a straightforward product-state implementation and the ensemble consists of multiple parameterizations of the same kernel family. The DRO-Lite component uses standard techniques. The integration feels more like engineering existing methods rather than fundamental innovation. Experimental validation is limited to two synthetic datasets with only 3000 samples each, which is restrictive for the robustness claims, especially for safety-critical applications. The evaluation protocol differs from standard streaming evaluation and may not reflect real scenarios. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear mathematical formulations, but some claims are overstated. The significance is questionable, as the core techniques are well-established and the combination is incremental. The originality is limited, with the main contribution being systems integration rather than novel research. Reproducibility is handled well, with detailed protocols and code availability. The authors are honest about limitations, but these significantly undermine broader claims. The related work section is adequate but could be improved. Major issues include limited experimental evaluation, overstated claims, questionable novelty, lack of quantum advantage, and evaluation protocol concerns. Minor issues include mathematical notation, misleading ensemble concept, and figures lacking analysis. Overall, the work demonstrates competent engineering but lacks the innovation and evaluation rigor expected for a top-tier venue."

The authors report significant improvements in worst-window accuracy over baselines on synthetic datasets. However, the paper suffers from major flaws: (1) incomplete methodological description, especially regarding the ensemble drift detection and density ratio estimation methods; (2) questionable and inconsistent experimental results, including discrepancies in ablation studies and the use of illustrative rather than actual data in plots; (3) arbitrary design choices, such as projecting all datasets to 4 dimensions without justification or sensitivity analysis. While the paper is generally well-written, these issues render it unclear and undermine its technical soundness and experimental validity. The combination of techniques is somewhat original, but the lack of rigorous validation and complete description diminishes its impact. Although reproducibility is supported by code, the paper itself is not self-contained. The discussion of limitations and ethics is exemplary. In summary, the paper addresses an important problem but is marred by critical flaws that prevent verification of its claims, and thus, I cannot recommend acceptance."

        "value": "Streaming binary classifiers suffer performance degradation under concept drift when data distributions change over time. We propose QISK (Quantum-Inspired Streaming Kernels), a quantum-inspired approach that integrates advanced drift detection, quantum kernel ensembles, and enhanced importance weighting for improved worst-case performance under distribution shift. Our method combines multiple quantum-inspired kernels with different parameterizations, advanced ensemble drift detection techniques, and multi-method density ratio estimation, implemented entirely through classical computation. The key innovations include an ensemble of quantum-inspired kernels, advanced DRO-Lite with multiple density ratio estimators, and sophisticated drift detection mechanisms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates improvements in worst-case performance, with QISK achieving 12-14\\% absolute improvements over state-of-the-art baselines."
