        "value": "The paper proposes a conceptual framework for analyzing intra-national cultural variation in China using a Yin–Yang lens and the Three Kingdoms macro-regions as a heuristic. Its strengths include conceptual clarity, strong organization, interdisciplinary ambition, and explicit attention to anti-essentialism and ethical safeguards. However, the framework lacks empirical rigor and operationalization, with no concrete definitions, indicators, or worked examples. There are risks of overgeneralization and anachronism in using the Three Kingdoms regions, oversimplification of dialect evidence, and significant gaps in engagement with foundational regional literature (notably Skinner’s macroregions and relevant dialectological and historical scholarship). Methodological vagueness, especially in infrastructure analysis, and insufficiently established originality over existing frameworks further weaken the contribution. The paper is commended for its ethical stance and clarity but requires substantial revision: deeper engagement with core literature, more precise dialect and demographic history, replacement of generalized sources with peer-reviewed evidence, a worked methodological prototype, formalization of constructs, and sharper originality claims. In its current form, the paper is thoughtful and important but underdeveloped empirically and insufficiently grounded, warranting a borderline rejection."

        "value": "This paper proposes using the Yin-Yang philosophical framework to analyze regional cultural variation in China, using the Three Kingdoms period as a case study. While the conceptual idea of applying Yin-Yang to avoid cultural essentialism has merit, the execution is deeply flawed. The authors admit to significant AI involvement, including hallucinations and unreliable sources, leading to manifold revisions and raising serious concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the analysis. The paper lacks rigorous empirical validation, with evidence provided serving more as illustrative examples than systematic analysis. The theoretical framework is not operationalized for systematic testing or comparison. The writing is generally clear and well-organized, but there is a disconnect between the ambitious theoretical claims and the limited evidence. The impact is limited, as the paper does not advance beyond existing work in meaningful ways, nor does it provide tools or methods for other researchers. The originality is limited by the heavy AI involvement, making it difficult to assess the genuine intellectual contribution. The authors explicitly state they cannot guarantee reproducibility, which is highly problematic for academic work. While limitations and ethical concerns are acknowledged, the extensive AI involvement raises further questions about authorship and intellectual contribution. The reference list is adequate, but source reliability is an issue. Major concerns include reproducibility, lack of empirical validation, limited advancement, questions about intellectual contribution, and source reliability. Overall, the paper reads more like a sophisticated AI-generated essay than a rigorous academic contribution, falling short of academic standards expected at top venues."

        "value": "This paper develops a theoretical-conceptual framework for analyzing intra-national cultural\nvariation in China by applying the Yin–Yang model as an anti-essentialist lens. Whereas most\nexisting cultural geography and cross-cultural studies rely on static typologies, the Yin–Yang\napproach foregrounds dynamic balance, historical contingency, and the co-presence of complementary\ntendencies. The Three Kingdoms macro-regions (Wei, Shu, Wu) are employed not as historical case\nstudies per se, but as a  *heuristic illustration* to demonstrate how regional\ncultural identities can be theorized as oscillating configurations of openness and consolidation,\ncontinuity and transformation. By integrating insights from philosophy, intercultural studies, and\nhistorical geography, the paper extends Yin–Yang theory beyond cross-national applications and\npositions it as a methodological alternative to dichotomous frameworks such as Hofstede’s\ncultural dimensions. The contribution lies not in empirical testing but in conceptual\nadvancement: showing how Yin–Yang can structure regional cultural analysis while\nsafeguarding against stereotyping. The framework has implications for cultural theory,\ncomparative geography, and intercultural methodology more broadly."

        "value": "This paper presents a theoretical-conceptual framework for analyzing intra-national cultural variation in China, using the Yin-Yang philosophy as a dynamic, anti-essentialist lens. The authors position this as an alternative to static, typological models of culture, such as Hofstede's dimensions, and use the Three Kingdoms period as a heuristic to illustrate the framework's utility. The paper synthesizes evidence from history, geography, linguistics, and archaeology to show how regional cultures can be understood as a shifting balance of complementary forces, rather than fixed traits. The main contribution is methodological and conceptual, providing a nuanced tool for cultural analysis.\n\nThe review is highly positive, describing the paper as thought-provoking, ambitious, and executed with clarity and rigor. It is considered an excellent fit for the conference, especially as an example of sophisticated human-AI collaboration in the social sciences. The argument is logical and coherent, with a strong definition and application of the Yin-Yang concept. The interdisciplinary evidence is a major strength, though the engagement with archaeology and linguistics is illustrative rather than deeply analytical. The authors are transparent about the paper's scope and limitations.\n\nThe paper is praised for its exceptional clarity, organization, and accessibility. Its significance is highlighted, as it offers a rare and valuable alternative to static cultural typologies, with broad potential for future application. The originality is noted, particularly in the novel application of Yin-Yang to intra-national historical and cultural geography and the innovative use of the Three Kingdoms period as a heuristic. The work is reproducible in terms of argument clarity and source documentation, and the authors' transparency about AI use is commended.\n\nEthically, the paper is exemplary, with thoughtful discussion of the risks of static typologies and the potential misuse of the Yin-Yang model. The limitations are acknowledged and handled with self-critical awareness.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper is strong, well-argued, and original, offering a significant conceptual contribution to cultural studies. Its theoretical elegance, clarity, and interdisciplinary synthesis are its primary strengths. The illustrative rather than exhaustive empirical grounding is acceptable given the paper's conceptual focus. The reviewer recommends clear acceptance for the conference."
