        "value": "This paper evaluates arithmetic reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models using a systematic evaluation of nine state-of-the-art models on the MATH-211 benchmark. The review assesses the paper across several key dimensions:\n\n- Quality (4/6): The paper is technically sound with appropriate experimental methodology and provides valuable empirical insights through systematic evaluation, prompt strategies, and scaling analysis. However, its main contribution is empirical benchmarking rather than novel methodological advances. Claims about \"perfect arithmetic reasoning\" are well-supported by 100% accuracy results for Claude-Sonnet-4 and Llama-4-Maverick.\n\n- Clarity (5/6): The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides sufficient methodological detail for reproduction. Figures effectively illustrate key findings, especially performance comparisons and speed-accuracy trade-offs.\n\n- Significance (3/6): The results are practically useful but not groundbreaking scientifically. The paper demonstrates that current SOTA models can achieve perfect performance on basic arithmetic tasks, which is valuable for practitioners but limited in scientific impact. Scaling and prompt engineering insights are incremental.\n\n- Originality (3/6): The study is primarily an evaluation that builds incrementally on existing work. The comprehensive comparison and focus on arithmetic reasoning provide some novelty, but the methodology and approach are standard. Prompt engineering insights are not particularly novel.\n\n- Reproducibility (5/6): The paper provides excellent reproducibility information, including detailed experimental setup, hardware specifications, prompt templates, and evaluation protocols. The commitment to release code upon acceptance is appropriate.\n\n- Ethics and Limitations (4/6): The authors address limitations, acknowledging the narrow scope and minimal ethical considerations. They discuss both positive impacts and deployment considerations.\n\n- Citations and Related Work (4/6): The related work section is comprehensive and positions the work well within the broader context.\n\nConcerns include limited significance and novelty, narrow scope, and some obvious results. Strengths include thorough methodology, clear presentation, practical insights, first documented cases of perfect arithmetic reasoning at this scale, useful scaling analysis, and findings about format compliance issues.\n\nOverall, the paper provides solid empirical contributions valuable to practitioners in scientific computing, but limited novelty and significance prevent it from reaching higher tiers of acceptance."

        "value": "Reliable arithmetic reasoning in Large Language Models is essential for advancing both mathematical education and scientific computing applications. This work evaluates arithmetic capabilities across nine state-of-the-art models using the MATH-211 benchmark, comprising 211 problems spanning fundamental operations from addition to logarithms. We find that Claude-Sonnet-4 and Llama-4-Maverick achieve 100\\% accuracy across all operation categories and difficulty levels, while other leading models achieve 95-99\\% accuracy. Our scaling analysis across the Qwen3 family (0.6B, 4B, 8B, 235B parameters) reveals non-linear improvements in arithmetic reliability, with the smallest model exhibiting catastrophic format compliance failures while larger variants achieve robust performance, culminating in near-perfect 99.5\\% accuracy at the 235B scale. Our analysis identifies significant architectural differences affecting reliability, with format compliance issues causing complete failure in smaller models. We demonstrate substantial efficiency gains through switching from a chain-of-thought prompt to direct-answering prompt, achieving up to 39.8$\\times$ speed improvements while maintaining high accuracy. These findings establish empirical benchmarks for arithmetic reliability and scaling behavior that can inform the development of educational tutoring systems, automated assessment tools, and scientific computing pipelines that require dependable mathematical foundations. Compared with a prior work\\citep{yuan2023arithmetic} where even the best-performing model (GPT-4) only achieved less than 90\\% accuracy on a similar benchmark, our work shows a significant improvement in thein the model's arithmetic capabilities. The work provides practical deployment guidelines for integrating LLM arithmetic capabilities into applications where mathematical correctness is critical."

        "value": "This work introduces a new benchmark for arithmetic operations for LLMs called Math-211. The authors analyze the performance of LLMs on performing basic arithmetic operations and show performance on different model scales. Their results show that SOTA LLMs get almost 100% accuracy across the benchmark, but smaller models such as 8B and 4B models suffer. The analysis of results also shows speed comparisons in computation, drawing conclusions about tradeoffs between prompting strategies (step-by-step vs. direct answer) and their effects on speed and accuracy."

        "value": "Strengths:\n- This work positions the field of benchmarking arithmetic capabilities of LLMs very well. The related work seems to capture the relevant previous attempts at this problem.\n- The analysis of results is described clearly and succinctly, and the figures demonstrate the central results well.\n- The authors present several useful analyses of LLM components that determine the performance on this benchmark, including on the model sizes and prompting strategies. The formatting issues identified are also useful to the field, especially given that this happens in a very small model.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The problem examined in this work is not necessarily impactful. It is very common now for LLMs to have attached tools such as calculators to perform arithmetic operations; it seems inefficient and unreliable to see if LLMs can perform these operations themselves.\n- The dataset proposed is not properly defined. For instance, no details are given on how the dataset was gathered or constructed, and no characteristics of the dataset are given.\n- The performance of SOTA models on the proposed dataset is 100%. This finding, while billed as \"the first documented cases of flawless arithmetic reasoning in LLMs at this scale\", raises concerns about the work, including the justification and usefulness of this dataset in evaluating LLMs. More description of the dataset proposed would aid in determining if these results are indeed suspicious or if this is an impactful finding, but this cannot be determined from the paper as it is currently written.\n- The authors often make grandiose statements about the results without proper acknowledgement of the limitations of this work. For instance, the authors say that this work \"provides definitive performance benchmarking that represents the first comprehensive evaluation demonstrating perfect arithmetic reasoning\". This is a misleading statement, and no statements are made to guard against suggesting that this work is groundbreaking or that it can be interpreted as \"solving\" arithmetic reasoning with LLMs."

The experimental methodology is rigorous and transparent, the evaluation protocol is reliable, and the results are clearly presented. The paper is original in documenting perfect arithmetic accuracy at this scale and across a diverse set of models, and it provides novel insights into format compliance as a failure mode in smaller models. The work is exceptionally well-written and organized, with sufficient detail for reproducibility, and the authors are commended for their transparency regarding AI involvement in the research process.\n\nWeaknesses are minor and include a minor inconsistency in the benchmark naming, slightly confusing temporal framing in the title and API access dates, and the lack of statistical significance testing due to practical constraints. These are acknowledged as minor suggestions for improvement rather than significant criticisms.\n\nOverall, this is a landmark paper that is technically flawless, presents groundbreaking results, and has exceptionally high impact. It sets a new standard for evaluating the arithmetic capabilities of LLMs and provides invaluable practical insights for the scientific community. The work is a perfect fit for the Agents4Science conference and is enthusiastically recommended for acceptance."

It finds perfect accuracy for two models, strong performance for others, and significant latency reductions with direct answers. The study is clear and focused, with useful observations and some reproducibility details. However, there are major concerns: (1) benchmark naming inconsistencies and incomplete specification, (2) evaluation design conflates mathematical correctness with formatting, (3) overclaiming relative to evidence, (4) lack of statistical rigor, and (5) reproducibility gaps. Additional issues include minor presentation inconsistencies. While the evaluation is timely and the observations are relevant, the originality is limited and the strongest claims are not fully supported due to benchmark and methodological limitations. The paper would benefit from resolving benchmark issues, clarifying evaluation criteria, improving statistical rigor, and releasing all materials for reproducibility. In its current form, the paper is not acceptable, but with substantial revisions, it could become a solid empirical study."
