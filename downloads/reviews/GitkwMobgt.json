The work is technically sound, highly original, and exceptionally well-written, with clear articulation of motivation, contributions, and limitations. The main weakness is the very limited empirical validation, which is insufficient to support the practical claims of the paper. The reviewer recommends either significantly strengthening the empirical section or re-framing the paper as a purely theoretical contribution. Despite this, the theoretical contribution is substantial and significant, making the paper a strong candidate for acceptance."

        "value": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) represents a paradigm shift in training AI systems by incorporating explicit reward verification mechanisms. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of how training data composition fundamentally affects RLVR performance across multiple dimensions: reward signal quality, verification complexity, and generalization capability. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we establish convergence guarantees, sample complexity bounds, and optimal data composition ratios for RLVR systems. We introduce the Verifiable Reward Consistency Index (VRCI) and its robust extension for noisy constraints (VRCI-R) with theoretical justification for their effectiveness. Our theoretical framework demonstrates that optimal RLVR performance requires a precise balance between verified and exploratory samples, with mathematical bounds on the optimal verification coverage ratio. We provide novel theoretical results on hierarchical verification constraints, noisy constraint handling, and the fundamental limits of verifiable learning. Additionally, we present preliminary empirical validation of our theoretical claims and practical implementation guidelines for real-world RLVR systems."

        "value": "This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), introducing formal definitions, theorems, and proofs. The mathematical framework is well-structured and technically sound, with convergence guarantees, sample complexity bounds, and novel VRCI metrics. However, the analysis relies on strong assumptions (Lipschitz continuity, finite state-action spaces) that may not hold in practice, and some proofs are relegated to appendices, making verification difficult. The paper is well-organized and clear, though dense for non-experts. Its significance lies in addressing AI safety, but the impact is limited by preliminary empirical validation (only synthetic GridWorld experiments), a gap between theory and real-world constraints, and limited evidence of practical improvements. The work is original, introducing new theoretical concepts and providing the first comprehensive analysis of RLVR. Theoretical results are reproducible, but experiments are limited. The authors acknowledge significant limitations and aim for positive ethical impact. Major concerns include the theory-practice gap, limited empirical validation, unclear practical applicability, and heavy AI involvement in the paper's creation. Minor issues include unclear notation, limited computational complexity analysis, and lack of discussion on continuous spaces. Overall, the paper makes solid theoretical contributions but is weakened by the gap between theory and practice and limited empirical validation, resulting in limited practical utility."

        "value": "This paper addresses an important and timely problem by proposing a theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), introducing new data quality metrics (VRCI/VRCI-R), and analyzing the impact of verified versus unverified data on convergence, sample complexity, and generalization. The exposition is clear at a high level, and the paper includes a dedicated limitations section and practical guidelines. The partitioning of data by verification confidence and the preliminary empirical study are positive aspects.\n\nHowever, the paper suffers from major weaknesses in technical rigor and correctness. There are inconsistencies and gaps in the theoretical development, such as the lack of reconciliation between hard and soft verification, undefined terms (e.g., RV), overly strong coverage assumptions, and sketchy or unsupported proofs for key theorems. The optimal coverage analysis contains algebraic errors, and several theoretical claims are not rigorously justified. The empirical validation is extremely limited, relying on a single small GridWorld experiment without statistical rigor or meaningful baselines. The positioning relative to related work is incomplete, missing key references and failing to clearly distinguish RLVR from existing frameworks. Definitions for core metrics (VRCI/VRCI-R) are under-specified, reducing reproducibility and clarity.\n\nWhile the motivation and some ideas are promising, the paper does not meet the standards of technical depth, correctness, and empirical support required for a strong venue. Substantial revisions are needed: formalizing the RLVR setting, fixing theoretical inconsistencies, providing rigorous proofs, expanding empirical validation, and deepening the related work section. In its current form, I recommend rejection."
