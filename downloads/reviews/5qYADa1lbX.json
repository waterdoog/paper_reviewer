        "value": "This paper, \"ChainML,\" presents an ambitious and comprehensive framework for decentralized, Byzantine-resilient AI training by combining federated learning, blockchain technology, and advanced cryptography. The vision is significant and the architecture is elegant, integrating a novel \"Proof-of-Learning\" consensus, cryptographic gradient verification, and a token-based economy. The paper is exceptionally well-written and clearly structured.\n\nHowever, there are several critical weaknesses that undermine its technical soundness and the validity of its claims:\n\n1. The claim of providing (ε, δ)-differential privacy is unsupported and fundamentally flawed, as the cryptographic mechanisms described do not guarantee differential privacy without the addition of proper noise mechanisms.\n2. The feasibility of using zk-SNARKs for large-scale neural networks is questionable, with the stated computational overhead appearing unrealistically low and lacking supporting evidence or benchmarks.\n3. Key mechanisms, such as the \"adaptive network topology\" and the link between incentivized participation and faster convergence, are vague or entirely unspecified.\n\nWhile the paper's vision and synthesis of components are original and significant, reproducibility is hampered by a lack of detail on cryptographic implementations and adaptive topology. The clarity of writing is excellent, but the technical errors and unsupported claims are fundamental.\n\nConclusion: The paper is promising but premature. Major revisions are required, including correcting the privacy claim, providing realistic analysis of cryptographic overhead, elaborating on key mechanisms, and strengthening theoretical proofs. I recommend rejection at this time, but encourage resubmission after substantial improvements."

        "value": "This paper presents ChainML, a framework combining blockchain technology with federated learning to enable decentralized AI training with Byzantine fault tolerance and economic incentives. The concept is interesting and timely, with potential impact, but the work has significant technical concerns. The theoretical framework is outlined but lacks rigorous proofs, and cryptographic components are insufficiently detailed. Experimental results are comprehensive but lack statistical significance and substantiation for key claims. The paper is generally well-written and organized, but critical technical details are missing or relegated to unavailable supplementary material, making reproduction difficult. The integration of proof-of-learning consensus with federated learning is novel, but the technical novelty is incremental. Practical deployment challenges and insufficient detail on implementation, cryptography, and economic mechanisms limit reproducibility and real-world applicability. The authors discuss limitations and ethics appropriately, but the related work section is somewhat superficial. Specific technical concerns include missing details on zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, consensus scalability, economic model parameters, and reliance on simulation rather than real deployment. The authors disclose full AI generation of the work, which explains some technical gaps. Overall, the paper is promising but not ready for acceptance due to lack of technical depth and reproducibility."

        "value": "The paper proposes ChainML, a blockchain-orchestrated federated learning framework aiming for Byzantine-resilience and privacy-preservation, with incentives via a token economy. The vision is ambitious and timely, combining blockchain, cryptographic verification, and robust federated learning, and the high-level system design is conceptually interesting. The experimental section claims performance close to centralized baselines and improved robustness.\n\nHowever, there are major concerns:\n- The claim of differential privacy is technically incorrect, as no DP mechanism is specified and cryptography alone does not imply DP.\n- The proof-of-learning consensus is under-specified, lacking details on protocol, security, and sybil resistance.\n- The soundness of ZK proofs against adversarial data is not analyzed, and the interplay with robust aggregation is unquantified.\n- Details on homomorphic encryption, key management, and overheads are missing.\n- The Byzantine tolerance claim is a restatement of standard BFT limits without a formal adversary or network model.\n- Convergence claims lack precise assumptions and verifiable proofs.\n- The empirical evaluation omits essential details, lacks reproducibility, and does not report variance or ablations. Key figures and cryptographic overhead measurements are missing. Cost and uptime claims lack methodology.\n- Security and economic analyses are missing, including sybil resistance, incentive compatibility, and privacy leakage beyond ZK/HE. Regulatory considerations are not addressed.\n- Related work coverage is incomplete, omitting key literature in PoL, ZKML, blockchain-FL, and robust aggregation.\n- The technical core is incomplete, with high-level algorithms and proof sketches but missing implementable details.\n- Limitations are acknowledged, but important risks are under-discussed.\n\nActionable suggestions include correcting the privacy claim, specifying the consensus and cryptographic constructions, providing rigorous experiments, expanding related work, addressing economic analysis, and releasing code/configs.\n\nRecommendation: Given the significant technical flaw (DP claim without DP mechanisms), under-specified protocol/crypto details, and insufficient experimental rigor, I cannot recommend acceptance at this time. The vision is promising, but the submission falls short of the standards for technical soundness and evidence required for a top venue."

While federated learning addresses some issues, it still relies on centralized coordination and lacks mechanisms for incentivizing participation or ensuring Byzantine fault tolerance. We introduce ChainML, a fully decentralized AI training framework that leverages blockchain technology for coordination, verification, and incentivization of distributed learning processes. Our approach combines proof-of-learning consensus mechanisms, cryptographic gradient verification, and economic incentives to enable trustless collaboration among untrusted participants. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove Byzantine fault tolerance up to 33\\% adversarial participants and establish convergence guarantees under asynchronous network conditions. Extensive experiments across computer vision, natural language processing, and scientific computing tasks demonstrate that ChainML achieves comparable accuracy to centralized training while providing superior robustness, privacy preservation, and scalability. The framework successfully coordinates training across 1000+ heterogeneous nodes with 99.7% uptime and 40% reduction in training costs through optimal resource utilization and participant incentivization."
