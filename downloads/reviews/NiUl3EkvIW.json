        "value": "This paper presents a hybrid framework for automated knowledge graph construction that combines LLM-driven ontology induction with rule-based information extraction and entity resolution. The work is technically sound, with a well-designed modular pipeline and clear separation between LLM and rule-based components. Experimental evaluation across three domains is thorough, but the resulting graphs are sparse and achieve only modest semantic quality scores (2.68-3.91/5). The novel LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation provides actionable insights but relies on a single model, which may introduce bias. The paper is well-written and organized, with transparent reporting of limitations and AI involvement. While the approach is practical and cost-effective, its impact is limited by low quality scores, sparse graph connectivity, and heavy reliance on rule-based extraction. The originality lies in the hybrid architecture and evaluation framework, though individual components are established. Reproducibility is supported by promised code release and detailed methodology. Ethics and limitations are discussed, but the coverage of related work could be improved. Overall, this is a solid engineering contribution with some novel aspects, but practical utility is constrained by quality and connectivity issues."

        "value": "The automated construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured text remains a central challenge in information management and artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that combines the conceptual reasoning of large language models (LLMs) with the efficiency of scalable, rule-based methods to deliver an end-to-end pipeline for KG construction and validation. The framework begins with ontology induction using an LLM to define domain-specific entity and relation types, followed by large-scale rule-based information extraction, entity resolution, and graph assembly. A novel extrinsic evaluation method, \\emph{LLM-as-a-Judge}, is employed to assess the semantic quality of the resulting graphs.\n\nWe evaluate the pipeline across three diverse benchmarks. In the financial domain, the FiQA dataset (5{,}500+ documents) yielded a graph with 475 nodes and 36 edges, achieving an overall quality score of 2.97/5 at a total cost of 2.63. In the document-level relation extraction setting, the DocRED dataset (100 annotated documents) produced 5{,}000 nodes and 389 edges, with a lower quality score of 2.68/5, primarily due to systematic entity type misclassification. In the biomedical domain, the CDR dataset (100 sampled abstracts) generated 966 nodes and 13 edges, but achieved the highest semantic precision, with an overall quality of 3.91/5 at a cost of 0.65. Across all datasets, the pipeline demonstrated efficiency, with end-to-end processing times under one hour, and highlighted complementary strengths and weaknesses: FiQA emphasized scale but sparse connectivity, DocRED revealed classification challenges, and CDR achieved high entity-level precision despite graph fragmentation.\nThese results validate the effectiveness of hybrid architectures for KG construction: LLMs provide strong conceptual modeling, while rule-based systems ensure scalability and cost-efficiency. The \\emph{LLM-as-a-Judge} framework further supplies actionable feedback, exposing domain-specific error modes and guiding refinement. Our work establishes a cost-effective, modular, and adaptable methodology for automated KG construction, offering a foundation for future research on improving connectivity, refining extraction accuracy, and extending to new domains."

        "value": "The paper proposes a modular, hybrid pipeline for end-to-end knowledge graph (KG) construction, using LLMs for ontology induction and evaluation, and deterministic, rule-based methods for information extraction, entity resolution, and graph assembly. The system is tested on three domains (FiQA, DocRED, CDR) and evaluated mainly via LLM-based scoring, emphasizing cost-efficiency and portability. Strengths include clear modular design, cross-domain demonstration, honest error analysis, and practical efficiency. However, major concerns are the lack of gold-standard or human evaluation, missing reproducibility details, absence of baselines or ablations, unexplained graph sparsity, under-specified LLM-as-a-Judge methodology, and questionable figures (e.g., entity typing errors in DocRED). The review finds the work's quality, significance, and originality limited by insufficient evaluation rigor, missing technical details, and lack of comparative analysis. Reproducibility is currently inadequate. The paper is transparent about limitations but needs more discussion on LLM-judging reliability and related work. Actionable suggestions include adding gold-standard evaluations, baselines, full reproducibility artifacts, reliability studies, ablations, and deeper analysis of pipeline bottlenecks. The verdict is that, despite a promising system framing and cost-consciousness, the evaluation is too weak for acceptance at a high-standard venue, and the reviewer recommends rejection."

        "value": "This paper presents a hybrid, modular framework for end-to-end knowledge graph (KG) construction and validation, combining Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level tasks with rule-based systems for information extraction and entity resolution. The framework is evaluated on three datasets (FiQA, DocRED, CDR), demonstrating low cost, high speed, and portability. A notable contribution is the use of an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" for final quality scoring and diagnostic feedback. Strengths include the pragmatic approach, strong experimental design across domains, cost efficiency, and transparency about limitations. However, the paper suffers from a critical lack of methodological detail, making it irreproducible, and the evaluation metric (LLM-as-a-Judge) is unvalidated. The related work section is weak, and the quality of generated KGs is modest. Major revisions are needed: detailed methodology, validation of the evaluation metric, and a stronger literature review. The foundation is promising, but the current work is incomplete. Recommendation: rejection, but open to reviewing a substantially revised version."
