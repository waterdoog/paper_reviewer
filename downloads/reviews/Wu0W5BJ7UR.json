        "value": "We study the stability of factor exposures in market portfolio models through the lens of dynamic regime shifts. Traditional asset pricing frameworks, such as the CAPM and Fama–French models, assume constant factor loadings, yet empirical evidence suggests that risk premia vary significantly across economic states. We propose a regime-switching multifactor model in which factor sensitivities are conditional on latent Markov regimes. Using simulated and empirical data, we show that market betas and style exposures differ systematically between bull, bear, and transitional states. Our likelihood-based tests reject the null of constant betas, and regime-aware portfolios exhibit higher Sharpe ratios and comparable drawdowns relative to static benchmarks. These results highlight the importance of modeling regime-dependent risk premia, offering both improved portfolio allocation and a framework to interpret structural shifts in financial markets."

        "value": "The paper proposes a Markov-switching multifactor regression with regime-dependent factor loadings, estimated via EM and Hamilton filtering, and evaluated on synthetic and US data using Fama–French 5 factors. While the technical approach is sound and the motivation is clear, there is a fundamental flaw: the main empirical analysis regresses the market excess return on the market factor itself, introducing tautology and endogeneity, which undermines the interpretability and validity of the results. Quantitative evidence is lacking, with no test statistics, confidence intervals, or detailed performance metrics reported. Key implementation and empirical details (e.g., regime selection, ablation studies, out-of-sample protocol, transaction costs) are missing, and the paper does not provide sufficient information for reproducibility. The originality is limited, as Markov-switching betas are well-studied, and the paper does not offer significant theoretical or empirical advances over existing literature. The ethical discussion is thoughtful, but related work is under-cited. Actionable suggestions include fixing the empirical design, providing rigorous quantitative results, justifying model selection, conducting ablations, improving robustness, and broadening citations. Overall, the paper addresses an important problem with a reasonable framework, but the current empirical design and lack of rigorous evidence make the claims unconvincing. Substantial revisions are needed for the work to be compelling."

        "value": "This paper presents a Markov-switching multifactor model for analyzing dynamic factor exposures in financial markets, arguing that traditional static models fail to capture regime-dependent risk premia. The model allows factor loadings, intercepts, and residual variances to switch between latent states and is evaluated on synthetic and empirical data. The authors claim the model identifies distinct risk regimes aligned with economic indicators and that a regime-aware portfolio outperforms a static benchmark.\n\nStrengths include clear writing, a well-structured manuscript, a sound methodological approach, and exceptional transparency regarding the research process, especially the use of AI agents and discussion of model risk and ethical considerations.\n\nHowever, the paper has critical weaknesses that make it unsuitable for publication at a top-tier conference in its current form:\n\n- The main claims lack rigorous, quantitative empirical evidence. The \"Empirical Results\" section is qualitative, with missing figures and no statistical tests or quantitative tables to support claims of statistical or economic significance.\n- The contribution is incremental, as Markov-switching models in asset returns are well-established, and the novelty is not demonstrated with strong empirical findings.\n- Reproducibility is poor: no code, data, or methodological details are provided, and the authors admit replication would be difficult. Key details about portfolio construction and experimental design are missing.\n- The lack of quantitative results and missing figures hinder clarity, and there is a minor proofreading error in the sample period.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper is a transparent and interesting case study of AI-driven research, it lacks the scientific rigor and reproducibility required for publication. A complete overhaul of the results section, with detailed quantitative evidence, formal statistical tests, and full methodological documentation, is necessary for consideration. The paper is a promising draft but does not yet meet the standards of a complete scientific contribution."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Dependent variable equals a factor: y_t is defined as the market excess return while MKT−RF is also included as a predictor (pages 3 and 5). This tautology invalidates claims about varying market beta (e.g., Figure 1 on page 6 and Figure 2 on page 7).\n- Number of regimes not selected or justified; no AIC/BIC, sensitivity analysis, or treatment of unidentified parameters under the null. Label switching, initialization strategy, and multiple random starts for EM not discussed.\n- Out-of-sample protocol and leakage: winsorization and normalization appear full-sample (page 5). Not specifying rolling scaling and whether filtered (not smoothed) probabilities drive trading introduces look-ahead.\n- Portfolio construction is not specified: no objective, constraints, rebalancing frequency, transaction costs, or turnover control, yet performance claims are made (Figure 3, page 7).\n- Statistical inference is incomplete: no standard errors or CIs for regime-dependent betas; no formal LRT or bootstrap procedure details for H1; no tests for Sharpe differences or CEQ uncertainty.\n- Synthetic validation lacks quantitative recovery metrics (parameter error, regime classification accuracy, calibration).\n- Minor data inconsistency: sample length appears off by about a year’s worth of months (page 5).\n- VIX alignment may be inflated if smoothed probabilities were used; the paper does not clarify filtered vs smoothed in Figures (page 7).\n- Reproducibility and experimental detail are acknowledged as lacking in the checklist (pages 12–15), limiting verification of results."

        "value": "This paper proposes a regime-switching multifactor model to study dynamic factor loadings in market portfolios. While the topic is interesting and relevant to finance, the paper has several significant issues that limit its contribution.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe paper lacks technical rigor in several areas. The mathematical formulation is standard regime-switching methodology without novel extensions. The empirical validation is incomplete - the authors claim to use data through December 2025 (line 149), which is clearly impossible as we're still in 2024. This suggests either fabricated data or serious errors in data handling. The synthetic data experiments, while useful for validation, use overly simplified assumptions that may not reflect real market dynamics. The lack of formal statistical significance testing (acknowledged in the checklist) undermines confidence in the results.\n\nClarity and Reproducibility:\nThe paper is generally well-written but suffers from reproducibility issues. The authors acknowledge in their checklist that full reproduction would be difficult without access to their AI workflow and prompts. Key experimental details like hyperparameters, data splits, and optimization settings are missing. The heavy reliance on AI-generated content (rated [C] across all categories) raises concerns about the depth of human understanding and validation of the methodology.\n\nMethodological Concerns:\nThe core methodology is not novel - it applies standard Hamilton regime-switching models to factor loadings, which has been explored in the literature. The paper doesn't clearly distinguish its contribution from existing work. The validation against stress indicators (VIX, NBER recessions) is superficial, relying mainly on visual correlation without formal statistical tests.\n\nAI Involvement Issues:\nWhile the authors are transparent about AI's role, the extent of AI involvement (>50% across all research stages) raises questions about the intellectual contribution and reliability. The authors note AI limitations including \"hallucinated mathematics,\" code errors, and overfitting risks, but don't adequately address how these were mitigated in the final results.\n\nEmpirical Results:\nThe claimed superior performance of regime-aware portfolios lacks statistical significance testing. The comparison is limited to basic performance metrics without accounting for transaction costs, market frictions, or out-of-sample stability. The sample period ending in 2025 is problematic and suggests data fabrication.\n\nMissing Elements:\n- No formal hypothesis testing for regime differences\n- Limited robustness checks\n- No consideration of transaction costs in portfolio evaluation  \n- Insufficient discussion of model selection (number of regimes)\n- No comparison with other time-varying parameter models\n\nPositive Aspects:\nThe paper addresses a relevant question in finance, provides clear motivation for the research, and includes appropriate literature review. The transparency about AI involvement and limitations is commendable for this venue.\n\nHowever, the technical flaws, reproducibility issues, questionable data claims, and limited novelty outweigh these positives. The paper would benefit from substantial revision addressing the methodological rigor, data validity, and statistical testing before it could make a meaningful contribution to the literature."
