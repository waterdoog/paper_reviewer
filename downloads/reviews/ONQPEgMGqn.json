The writing is clear and the structure logical, with transparent reporting of the AI-driven methodology and its limitations. However, the work is entirely AI-generated with minimal human intellectual input, raising concerns about the depth of scientific insight and critical analysis. The most significant issues are the acknowledged propensity for fabricated ('hallucinated') references, lack of original data or novel analytical frameworks, and non-reproducibility due to reliance on proprietary AI models. While the topic is relevant and the coverage comprehensive, the absence of novel insights, critical analysis, and reliable references fundamentally undermines the paper's scientific integrity and suitability for acceptance. The positive aspects do not outweigh these critical limitations."

The process involves draft generation by Gemini, peer-like review and validation by ChatGPT, and iterative refinement. \n\nStrengths include: (1) groundbreaking methodological originality with a generator-evaluator model to address LLM hallucinations, (2) exceptional quality of the scientific output, (3) exemplary transparency and scientific rigor, and (4) high significance and impact for the field of AI agents in science. \n\nWeaknesses are minor and include: (1) a need for more detail on the iterative refinement process, (2) a discussion of potential biases from using proprietary LLMs, and (3) more information on prompt engineering for reproducibility. \n\nOverall, the paper is technically sound, highly original, and of immense significance to the Agents4Science community. The reviewer strongly recommends acceptance."

        "value": "This submission is a narrative, AI-generated qualitative literature review on how major post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate core fibrotic pathways across multiple organs. The review is timely, well-organized, and accessible, with helpful pathway summaries and a useful summary table. However, it has significant weaknesses: it largely recapitulates established knowledge without offering a novel synthesis or formal framework; the methodology is narrative rather than systematic, lacking transparency and reproducibility; there are reference inconsistencies and probable errors; key mechanistic areas (especially glycosylation and PTM crosstalk) are underdeveloped; the AI pipeline is insufficiently documented for reproducibility; and the translational synthesis is limited. Constructive suggestions include converting to a systematic review, deepening mechanistic coverage, providing a unifying analytic framework, enhancing translational relevance, and fully documenting the AI process. Overall, while readable and relevant, the manuscript requires substantial revision—especially a shift to a systematic methodology with verifiable references and a more original, data-backed integrative framework—to be suitable for acceptance at a selective venue."

        "value": "Fibrosis, the final common pathway of numerous chronic diseases, is a major pathological process that destroys tissue architecture and function through excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. Genomic information alone cannot fully explain the complex and dynamic progression of fibrosis; Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs), a key regulatory mechanism of protein function, play a decisive role. This qualitative literature review provides an in-depth analysis of the correlation between fibrotic mechanisms and PTMs, offering an integrated perspective on how PTMs exquisitely control key fibrosis-related signaling pathways. It details how major PTMs—including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, SUMOylation, and glycosylation—modulate core fibrotic signaling axes such as Transforming Growth Factor-$\\beta$ (TGF-$\\beta$), Wnt, STAT3, and Rho/ROCK. Specifically, PTMs act as 'molecular switches' that regulate protein stability, enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, and protein-protein interactions, thereby determining the intensity, duration, and ultimate outcome of signals. Furthermore, this review compares and analyzes the commonalities and specificities of PTM regulatory mechanisms in fibrosis across major organs like the heart, liver, kidney, and lung. It also explores how PTM crosstalk, such as the tandem activation of acetylation and phosphorylation, functions as the 'grammar' of a complex biological language. Finally, it illuminates the potential and challenges of the latest anti-fibrotic therapeutic strategies targeting PTM-related enzymes, including kinases, histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and E3 ligases. This will lay the theoretical foundation for developing precision anti-fibrotic therapies based on PTM proteomics, the comprehensive analysis of proteome modifications."
