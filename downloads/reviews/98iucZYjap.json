        "value": "This paper presents a systematic, computational framework for designing a pooled CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of T cell exhaustion. The authors integrate data from literature, gene set enrichment databases, and gene essentiality databases to prioritize 32 target genes using a transparent, weighted scoring algorithm. A major contribution is a comprehensive experimental protocol for conducting the screen. The technical quality is excellent, with a robust and well-reasoned approach to gene prioritization and a detailed, quantitative protocol. The paper is exceptionally well-written, clear, and logically organized, with reproducible methods and explicit parameters. Its significance is high, addressing a major problem in cancer immunotherapy and providing a tool that could accelerate discovery. The originality lies in synthesizing known computational techniques into a complete framework and in demonstrating an AI agent autonomously performing complex scientific tasks. The authors are transparent about limitations and ethical considerations, and the reproducibility is outstanding. The only minor weakness is a short reference list. Overall, this is an excellent, rigorous, and highly relevant paper that sets a high standard for the conference. Strongly recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper presents a systematic computational approach to design a CRISPR knockout screen for identifying regulators of T cell exhaustion using an AI framework (BioPLE). The technical approach is methodologically sound, integrating multiple data sources with a transparent scoring algorithm, and the gene panel covers relevant functional categories. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed protocols and reproducibility ensured by available code and data. However, the work is purely computational with no experimental validation, which limits its biological impact. The contribution is mainly computational target prioritization, with most genes already known as exhaustion regulators, and the AI-driven aspect does not fundamentally change the nature of the approach. The literature review is adequate but could be more comprehensive. Major concerns include limited novelty, lack of experimental validation, unclear added value of AI, and missing benchmarking against human-designed or alternative computational methods. Minor issues include some repetitive content, a basic figure, and an overly detailed checklist section. Overall, this is competent computational biology but lacks the innovation, validation, and impact expected for top-tier venues."

        "value": "The paper proposes an AI-driven, systematic design for a pooled CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of T cell exhaustion, integrating literature-derived support, gene essentiality estimates, and a weighted scoring scheme. It provides practical screen parameters and sgRNA design guidelines. Strengths include the importance of the problem, practical details, transparency, and acknowledgment of limitations. However, there are major concerns: gene list inconsistencies and duplication, questionable essentiality statistics, and a support metric that may not be biologically specific. Methodological details are missing or underspecified, including lack of validation, incomplete phenotype and analysis plans, insufficient biological context, and unclear cross-species mapping. The work is a design framework rather than an experimental advance and lacks originality or demonstrated superiority over prior approaches. Key related work is under-cited. Minor concerns include reporting style, unspecified positive controls, and lack of reproducibility details. Actionable suggestions are provided to address these issues. Overall, despite the importance of the problem and the intent to standardize CRISPR screen design, the submission has substantive inconsistencies, questionable reporting, insufficient methodological specificity, and no validation, and does not meet the bar for acceptance in its current form."

        "value": "Background: T cell exhaustion represents a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy, char-13\nacterized by progressive loss of effector functions and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors.14\nWhile immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown clinical promise, their modest response rates high-15\nlight the need for systematic identification of novel therapeutic targets regulating exhaustion path-16\nways.17\nMethods: We designed a comprehensive CRISPR knockout screen targeting genes that regulate T18\ncell exhaustion. Through systematic literature review and computational analysis of gene essen-19\ntiality data (DepMap) and gene set enrichment databases (MSigDB, MouseMine), we prioritized20\ncandidate genes across functional categories including immune checkpoints, transcriptional regu-21\nlators, metabolic modulators, and epigenetic factors. A transparent scoring algorithm combined22\nforced inclusion of canonical exhaustion regulators with gene set support metrics and essentiality23\nassessments to maximize perturbation effects while minimizing viability confounds.24\nResults: We identified 32 target genes spanning immune checkpoints (PDCD1, CTLA4, HAVCR2,25\nLAG3, TIGIT), master transcriptional regulators (TOX, NR4A1, BATF, PRDM1), metabolic regu-26\nlators (PPARGC1A, HIF1A, MTOR), and epigenetic modulators (EZH2, BRD4, DNMT3A). Gene27\nset analysis revealed substantial literature support (mean support count: 12728\npm 156 across MSigDB and MouseMine databases). DepMap analysis identified potential viability29\nrisks for essential genes, informing recommendations for CRISPRi approaches where appropriate.30\nWe developed a quantitative screening protocol specifying cell coverage (1000 cells/guide), trans-31\nduction parameters (MOI 0.3), and sequencing depth requirements (1000 reads/guide/sample).32\nConclusions: This systematic approach produced a validated 32-gene panel with comprehensive33\nexperimental protocols for pooled CRISPR screening of T cell exhaustion regulators. The prioritized34\ngenes represent diverse mechanistic pathways and are expected to yield novel therapeutic targets35\nfor enhancing T cell function in cancer and chronic infections.
