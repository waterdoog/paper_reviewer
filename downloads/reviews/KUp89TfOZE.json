        "value": "This paper introduces a long-range non-reciprocal Ising model to study the stability of non-equilibrium time-dependent phases, specifically demonstrating that long-range interactions can stabilize a \"swap phase\" (oscillatory time crystal behavior) in two dimensions where the short-range equivalent would be unstable.\n\nQuality:\nThe work is technically sound with appropriate methodologies. The use of Monte Carlo simulations with FFT optimization for long-range interactions is computationally efficient and well-implemented. The mean-field analysis provides theoretical grounding, and the finite-size scaling analysis is rigorous with proper data collapse demonstrating a continuous phase transition. The identification of critical exponents and the power-law scaling of temporal coherence (τc ∝ L^1.95) are convincing. However, the model is quite idealized (binary spins, regular lattice, specific two-replica framework) which limits direct applicability to real systems.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized. The mathematical formulation is precise, with the \"selfish energy\" concept well-explained. Figures are informative and support the main claims effectively. The progression from mean-field theory to numerical results is logical. The supplementary material provides adequate detail for reproducibility.\n\nSignificance:\nThe results are scientifically significant, demonstrating that long-range interactions can qualitatively change phase behavior in non-equilibrium systems. The finding that d=2 is the critical dimension for swap phase stability is important for understanding non-equilibrium phase transitions. The work bridges equilibrium long-range physics with non-reciprocal active matter, opening new research directions. The applications to neuromorphic computing and Ising machines are potentially valuable.\n\nOriginality:\nThe combination of long-range and non-reciprocal interactions in the Ising model appears to be novel and unexplored territory. The systematic study of how interaction range affects phase stability is original. The identification of the swap phase as a robust time crystal with diverging temporal coherence is a significant new finding.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors provide comprehensive computational details and promise code availability. The methodology is clearly described with specific parameters, system sizes, and simulation protocols. The supplementary material includes convergence tests and detailed parameter specifications.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors appropriately discuss limitations of their idealized model and suggest extensions to more realistic systems. The work is purely theoretical/computational with no obvious ethical concerns.\n\nCitations and Related Work:\nThe paper adequately cites relevant literature spanning Ising models, long-range interactions, and non-reciprocal systems. The positioning relative to prior work is clear.\n\nConcerns:\n1. The model is highly idealized - real systems rarely have perfect power-law interactions or the specific two-replica structure used here.\n2. The mean-field theory shows quantitative discrepancies with simulations, suggesting fluctuation effects may be more important than acknowledged.\n3. The applications section, while interesting, feels somewhat speculative given the model's abstraction from realistic systems.\n4. The critical exponents found (ν ≈ 3.0, β/ν ≈ 0.015) are unusual and would benefit from more theoretical understanding of this universality class.\n\nAI Involvement Note:\nThis paper was primarily generated by AI (as disclosed in the checklist), which raises questions about the depth of physical intuition behind the work, though the technical execution appears sound.\n\nOverall, this is solid theoretical work that makes a clear contribution to our understanding of non-equilibrium phase transitions, despite limitations in model realism."

        "value": "The paper introduces a novel two-replica long-range, non-reciprocal Ising model and reports a spatio-temporally ordered “swap phase” in 2D, behaving as a classical time crystal. The work is timely and potentially impactful, with clear motivation and a compelling qualitative narrative. The use of interpretable order parameters and extensive simulations are strengths, as is the intent to release code and document computational details.\n\nHowever, there are major concerns that undermine the central claims:\n- Internal inconsistencies and likely errors in figures and text (e.g., mislabeled figures, contradictory and unphysical critical exponents, notational instability) directly affect the reliability of the results.\n- Methodological ambiguity regarding the implementation of long-range Monte Carlo updates with FFT, lacking precise algorithmic description and validation, raises questions about the correctness of the dynamics.\n- Statistical rigor is insufficient: error bars, averaging, and uncertainty estimates are inconsistently reported or missing for key results, and the finite-size scaling analysis is not convincing due to contradictory exponents.\n- Some claims, especially regarding time-crystal behavior, are overstated without requisite checks (e.g., phase diffusion suppression, robustness to perturbations, and scaling of the phase diffusion constant).\n- Literature and presentation issues (duplicate references, non-anonymized code link) further detract from the manuscript.\n\nActionable suggestions include clarifying and validating the update scheme, correcting figure and text inconsistencies, strengthening statistical analysis, documenting kernel construction, substantiating the time-crystal claim with additional measurements, and improving the literature review.\n\nConclusion: The topic is promising, but critical inconsistencies, methodological ambiguities, and insufficient statistical rigor materially undermine confidence in the results. A thorough revision addressing these points is needed. Recommendation: Reject (for now)."

        "value": "Non-reciprocal interactions are a hallmark of systems far from thermal equilibrium, from active matter to social networks, yet the principles governing the stability of the time-dependent phases they produce are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the role of long-range interactions in stabilizing such non-equilibrium states. We introduce a long-range, non-reciprocal Ising model and demonstrate through large-scale simulations that long-range couplings are a crucial mechanism for stabilizing a spatio-temporally ordered \"swap phase\" in two dimensions—a regime where the equivalent short-range model is unstable. We show that this phase behaves as a robust time crystal, with a temporal coherence that diverges with system size $L$ as a power law, $\\tau_c \\propto L^{1.95}$. Furthermore, we use finite-size scaling analysis to rigorously characterize the transition from a disordered state into the swap phase, finding it to be a continuous phase transition with a precisely located critical point, confirmed by an excellent data collapse. By showing that the swap phase is a generic feature, robust to asymmetries in the coupling, our work provides a clear and quantitative link between the range of interactions and the emergence of stable, dynamic order in non-equilibrium many-body systems"

The study combines mean-field theory and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, providing evidence that long-range interactions stabilize a robust classical time crystal phase. The methodology is rigorous, employing state-of-the-art numerical techniques and a thorough finite-size scaling analysis. The paper is exceptionally well-written, highly original, and exemplary in reproducibility, with public code and detailed computational protocols.\n\nHowever, the submission contains a critical technical flaw: a severe contradiction in the analysis of the time crystal behavior. The scaling of the temporal coherence time (Tc) with system size is inconsistently reported between the text and Figure 3c, undermining a central claim of the paper. This inconsistency is a fatal flaw that must be resolved before publication. There is also a minor issue with inconsistent and unphysical critical exponents in Figure 4d's caption. While the paper is otherwise of very high quality and potentially highly significant, the major technical error precludes acceptance in its current form. The authors are encouraged to resolve these issues, after which the work would likely merit publication in a top-tier venue."
