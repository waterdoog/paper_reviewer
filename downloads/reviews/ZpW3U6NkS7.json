        "value": "This paper explores the application of deep learning models to scientific claim verification using a simplified setup with the MNIST dataset. While the research addresses an important problem area, there are several significant concerns that affect the paper's quality and contribution.\n\nQuality Issues: The paper suffers from fundamental conceptual problems. The authors frame arithmetic operations on MNIST digits (e.g., \"The sum of digits is even\") as \"scientific claim verification,\" which is a significant overreach. These are basic mathematical facts rather than scientific claims requiring verification. The experimental design is relatively sound, but the interpretation overgeneralizes the findings. The modest performance (85% on MNIST) and poor generalization to other datasets are not surprising given the simplicity of the task and architectural choices.\n\nClarity Problems: The paper is generally well-written and organized, but the framing is misleading. The title and abstract promise insights into scientific claim verification when the work actually demonstrates basic multimodal learning challenges on trivial arithmetic tasks. The methodology is clearly described, and the experimental setup is adequately documented for reproduction.\n\nLimited Significance: The contributions are incremental at best. The finding that a simple CNN+BERT architecture struggles with generalization and adversarial inputs is not novel or surprising. The work doesn't advance our understanding of scientific claim verification in any meaningful way, as the tasks are too simplified to draw meaningful conclusions about real scientific reasoning. The insights about current multimodal architectures are already well-known in the field.\n\nOriginality Concerns: While the specific combination of MNIST with claim verification framing may be novel, the core insights about multimodal learning limitations and generalization challenges are well-established. The paper doesn't introduce new methods or provide substantially new understanding of existing challenges.\n\nReproducibility: The paper provides adequate detail for reproduction, including hyperparameters and experimental setup. The authors indicate code availability, which supports reproducibility.\n\nMissing Elements: The paper lacks several important components:\n- No discussion of limitations (acknowledged in checklist)\n- No statistical significance testing or error bars\n- No computational resource information\n- No broader impact discussion\n- Insufficient related work coverage\n\nAdditional Concerns: The AI involvement checklist reveals this paper was generated almost entirely by an AI system (AI Scientist V2), with minimal human involvement. While this is disclosed, it raises questions about the depth of understanding and genuine contribution to scientific knowledge. The authors acknowledge the AI system's limitations, including frequent bugs and incomplete outputs.\n\nOverall Assessment: This paper addresses an important general problem but does so in a way that provides minimal insights. The overselling of arithmetic tasks as \"scientific claim verification\" undermines the credibility of the work. The technical execution is adequate but the contributions are not sufficient for a high-quality venue. The findings are predictable given the experimental setup and don't advance the field meaningfully."

        "value": "This paper introduces a synthetic task for multimodal scientific claim verification using MNIST digit images paired with textual claims. The authors use a standard multimodal architecture (CNN + frozen BERT) and show that while the model performs moderately on in-distribution data, it fails to generalize to other domains and is not robust to input permutations or adversarial claims. The paper's strengths include a novel and intuitive problem formulation, well-designed experiments probing model weaknesses (generalization, permutation invariance, adversarial robustness), and clear writing. However, the paper suffers from major weaknesses: extremely poor quality and misleading figures (especially the so-called 'confusion matrices'), complete absence of a limitations section, insufficient related work (not citing benchmarks like CLEVR), and missing experimental details (e.g., vision encoder specification, undefined metrics). Overall, while the idea is valuable and the experimental design is thoughtful, the execution and presentation are deeply flawed, making the paper unsuitable for acceptance without major revision."

Traditional methods rely on text-based evidence and often lack visual or structured reasoning capabilities. We introduce a novel approach using the MNIST dataset to simulate simplified scientific claim verification tasks. We pair claims such as \"The sum of digits is even\" with digit images to test models' ability to assess truthfulness based on visual evidence. Our findings highlight significant challenges in training models that can reliably perform such verification tasks, underscoring the limitations of current multimodal architectures in structured reasoning scenarios."

        "value": "The paper investigates multimodal scientific claim verification using a synthetic setup pairing MNIST digit images with textual claims, training a CNN + frozen BERT model to predict truthfulness. The study finds moderate validation accuracy (~85%) on MNIST, poor cross-domain generalization, strong sensitivity to input order, and vulnerability to adversarial claims. While the problem is clearly framed and negative results are potentially useful, the design is limited to a single baseline, lacks principled aggregation for multi-image inputs, and omits comparisons to set reasoning or compositional architectures. Key implementation and evaluation details are missing, including feature pooling, claim grammar, dataset sizes, and adversarial claim construction. The evaluation lacks statistical rigor, multiple seeds, and formal definitions for new metrics. The work is relevant as a diagnostic but overstates its significance as 'scientific claim verification' and lacks novelty, breadth of baselines, and connections to established benchmarks. Reproducibility is hindered by insufficient detail. The related work section is sparse and omits central literature. The paper would benefit from formalizing the benchmark, expanding baselines, improving evaluation rigor, and reframing its contribution. Overall, the work highlights real challenges but lacks the novelty, rigor, and contextualization required for acceptance. Recommendation: rejection in its current form."
