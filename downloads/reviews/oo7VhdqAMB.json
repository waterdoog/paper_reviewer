        "value": "This paper presents a two-stage pipeline for insider threat detection in enterprise email logs, combining scalable behavioral anomaly filtering with focused LLM-based semantic analysis. The work is well-motivated, addressing the critical challenge of balancing detection scale with the need for contextual, interpretable alerts in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. The proposed methodology is sound, practical, and aligns well with real-world operational workflows.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Clarity and Organization: The paper is exceptionally well-written and structured. The motivation is clear, the methodology is described in detail, and the results are presented logically. The abstract and introduction provide a concise yet comprehensive overview, making the paper easy to follow and understand.\n\n2. Technical Quality: The proposed two-stage architecture is elegant and pragmatic. Stage 1 employs a sensible combination of engineered features (continuous, binary, and psychometric) with a standard anomaly detection algorithm (Isolation Forest) to create a hybrid risk score. This is a solid, scalable approach for an initial triage. Stage 2's application of an LLM for generating human-readable narratives on a small, high-risk subset is an intelligent use of expensive computational resources, directly tackling the \"alert fatigue\" problem by providing context and potential intent.\n\n3. Thorough Evaluation: The evaluation is comprehensive, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. The exploratory data analysis (Figure 1, Table 1) effectively demonstrates that the engineered features provide strong statistical separation between suspicious and normal activity. The benchmarking on a proxy-labeled subset, while circular by definition, serves its stated purpose as a \"sanity check\" and shows the risk score is internally consistent, achieving an impressive ROC-AUC of up to 0.96. The qualitative examples of LLM-generated narratives (Table 4) are compelling and clearly illustrate the value added by Stage 2.\n\n4. Honesty and Transparency: The authors should be commended for their candid discussion of the work's limitations. They are upfront about the use of synthetic data (CERT dataset) and, most importantly, the nature of the \"proxy-based\" labels used for quantitative evaluation. This transparency builds trust and allows the reader to correctly interpret the results as strong indicators of feasibility rather than production-ready performance claims.\n\n5. Significance and Impact: The paper makes a significant practical contribution. The \"filter-then-analyze\" paradigm is a generalizable and highly valuable template for applying large, powerful models in resource-constrained environments. The 100x reduction in data volume for the LLM stage demonstrates the system's practicality. The focus on generating auditable, SOC-style narratives is a crucial step towards building trustworthy and usable AI-assisted security tools.\n\nWeaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Evaluation on Proxy Labels: The primary weakness, which the authors correctly identify, is the evaluation on proxy labels derived from the model's own risk scores. This demonstrates consistency but not necessarily true detection performance on ground-truth malicious events. While the CERT dataset has ground truth, mapping it to individual emails can be challenging. The authors could strengthen the paper by attempting to correlate their high-risk flagged emails with the known insider threat scenarios in the dataset, even if it's a partial or heuristic mapping. This would provide a more grounded evaluation than the current self-referential benchmark.\n\n2. Ablation Study: The hybrid risk score combines an anomaly score, binary flags, and psychometric priors. It is unclear what the marginal contribution of each component is. An ablation study analyzing the performance of the risk score without psychometrics, or without the binary flags, would provide valuable insight into which features are most discriminative and justify the complexity of the hybrid approach.\n\n3. Minor Formatting Issues: There are several inconsistencies in the text's references to table numbers (e.g., line 181 refers to \"Table 8\" when the subsequent table is \"Table 2\"). These are minor errors but should be corrected for the final version to improve readability.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is an excellent paper that is technically sound, clearly presented, and addresses a problem of high practical importance. The proposed two-stage pipeline is a thoughtful and effective solution for scalable and interpretable insider threat detection. Despite the limitations inherent in using synthetic data and proxy labels, the work provides compelling evidence for the value of combining classical anomaly detection with modern LLM-based semantic analysis. The paper is a perfect fit for the Agents4Science conference, not only as a strong piece of applied AI research but also, according to the checklist, as a remarkable demonstration of an AI agent's ability to conduct and document scientific work from hypothesis to conclusion. It sets a high bar for the field. I strongly recommend acceptance."

We present a two-stage pipeline that mirrors SOC practice: Stage–1 performs scalable behavioral anomaly filtering on engineered features (continuous metrics, interpretable binary flags, and weak psychometric priors), producing a hybrid risk score; Stage–2 applies an LLM only to the top-risk subset to generate concise SOC-style narratives that surface intent. Using the full CERT v6 email corpus (∼2.63M messages,∼1k users), we show that engineered features capture strong separations between suspicious and background traffic, total-risk scores yield solid baselines, and semantic narratives improve analyst coverage while keeping cost practical (about 100×reduction in LLM load)."

        "value": "This paper presents a two-stage pipeline for insider threat detection combining behavioral anomaly filtering with LLM-enhanced semantic analysis. The technical approach is sound but not particularly novel, relying on Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and LLM-generated explanations. The use of the CERT v6 dataset and reasonable feature engineering are strengths, but the evaluation's reliance on synthetic data with proxy labels limits real-world applicability. Reported ROC-AUC scores (0.92-0.96) should be interpreted cautiously. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with adequate methodological explanation and supporting figures/tables. The contribution is mainly an engineering combination of existing techniques, with practical benefits (e.g., 100x reduction in LLM processing load) but lacking theoretical depth or significant innovation. The hybrid anomaly+LLM approach is not novel, though the CERT dataset application adds some domain value. Reproducibility is good, aided by dataset and algorithm details, though LLM variability is noted. Ethical considerations and limitations are appropriately acknowledged. Related work coverage is adequate but could be more comprehensive. Major issues include over-reliance on synthetic data, limited evaluation of the semantic component, lack of comparison with other methods, and unsubstantiated improvement claims. Minor issues include text repetition, underdeveloped psychometric integration, and missing LLM prompt details. Overall, the paper is competent engineering work with practical merit but lacks the theoretical contribution, rigorous evaluation, or innovation expected for a top-tier venue."

        "value": "The paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for insider threat detection on the CERT v6 synthetic email corpus, combining scalable behavioral anomaly filtering (Stage-1) and LLM-based semantic review (Stage-2). Strengths include a reasonable two-stage design, strong feature separation, high baseline results on proxy-labeled data, pragmatic cost reduction, and clear pseudo-code in the appendix. However, the evaluation relies heavily on synthetic data and proxy labels derived from the same hybrid score, risking circularity and lacking validation against ground truth or human annotation. The incremental value of Stage-2 is asserted but not rigorously quantified, with no human evaluation or error analysis. Key implementation details are missing, including LLM prompts, keyword lists, and hyperparameters, impeding reproducibility. The use of psychometric priors is ethically sensitive and not justified with fairness or bias analysis. Some sections are incomplete or duplicated, and internal references are inconsistent. While the pipeline is clearly described at a high level, specifics are underspecified, and the impact is limited by the lack of real-world evaluation and rigorous demonstration of analyst benefit. The methodological novelty is modest, and reproducibility is hampered by insufficient detail and reliance on proxy labels. Ethical considerations around psychometrics are underdeveloped. The related work section is thin and lacks up-to-date coverage. Actionable suggestions include using validated ground truth, quantifying Stage-2 impact, providing ablations, detailing implementation and costs, strengthening fairness analysis, and improving clarity. In conclusion, the paper addresses a relevant problem with a practical architecture and promising preliminary results, but the evaluation is insufficiently rigorous, and ethical handling is lacking. I recommend rejection in its current form; with the suggested improvements, it could become a solid contribution in the future."
