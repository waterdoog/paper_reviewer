        "value": "The paper introduces a Pathology-Aware Variational Autoencoder (PA-VAE) for augmenting labeled medical imaging data, specifically in a low-label regime using synthetic chest radiographs. The method augments a conditional VAE with a feature-preservation loss and a class-conditional latent prior, and demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines in downstream classification, calibration, fidelity, and reconstruction quality on a synthetic 64×64 chest X-ray benchmark. The reproducibility of the pipeline is emphasized, with ablations highlighting the importance of the proposed losses.\n\nStrengths include sound problem motivation, a simple and practical method, consistent improvements across several metrics (AUC, sensitivity, ECE, FID-like, SSIM), informative ablations, a focus on reproducibility, and inclusion of a Responsible AI statement.\n\nHowever, the primary limitation is that all evaluation is on synthetic data, severely limiting external validity and clinical relevance. The approach combines known techniques and lacks significant novelty, with insufficient positioning against prior work. Key implementation details are missing or underspecified, impeding reproducibility. The experimental design lacks statistical rigor (no confidence intervals or multiple runs), omits stronger contemporary baselines (e.g., diffusion models), and does not explore higher resolutions or provide quantitative robustness analysis. Editorial issues and inconsistent dataset references further detract from clarity.\n\nThe significance is currently limited by synthetic-only evaluation and modest incremental novelty. Ethical considerations are addressed, but a deeper discussion of synthetic data risks is recommended.\n\nActionable recommendations include: evaluating on real-world datasets, providing full implementation details, adding stronger baselines, reporting quantitative robustness, exploring higher resolutions, including statistical uncertainty, clarifying baselines and mask usage, and cleaning up editorial issues.\n\nVerdict: The idea is reasonable and results are reproducible, but the lack of real-data evaluation, incomplete methodological details, and limited novelty preclude acceptance at a high-standard venue. With real-world validation and clearer methodology, the work could become more compelling."

        "value": "This paper presents a Pathology-Aware Variational Autoencoder (PA-VAE) for synthetic medical imaging in chest radiography, specifically targeting low-label regimes. The approach is technically sound, with a well-motivated architecture that incorporates feature-preservation loss and class-conditional latent priors. The experimental setup is appropriate, using simulated chest X-ray data with 10% labeled samples. However, the evaluation is limited to 64×64 resolution synthetic data, which significantly limits clinical relevance, and baseline comparisons are somewhat limited. Some results appear inconsistent, such as discrepancies in reported AUC values. The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear methodology and sufficient experimental detail, though the related work section is brief. The impact is moderate due to the use of synthetic data, low resolution, modest improvements, and simplified pathology classes. The originality is incremental, combining known components in a reasonable but not groundbreaking way. Reproducibility is a strong point, with excellent support and promised code release. Ethical considerations and limitations are adequately addressed. The related work section could be more comprehensive. Specific issues include AUC discrepancies, low resolution, synthetic data evaluation, limited state-of-the-art comparisons, and an overly simplified pathology model. Strengths include clear motivation, excellent reproducibility, comprehensive ablation studies, transparent AI disclosure, and solid methodology. Overall, the paper addresses a relevant problem with reasonable rigor, but its limitations restrict its impact for the broader medical imaging community."

The method uses a feature-preservation loss and a class-conditional prior, and is evaluated on a synthetic chest radiograph benchmark, showing improvements in classification and image generation metrics compared to baselines. The paper is commended for its commitment to reproducibility.\n\nHowever, the reviewer identifies several major weaknesses that make the paper unsuitable for publication in its current form. The main concerns are:\n- The experimental evaluation is only on a procedurally generated, low-resolution (64x64) dataset, lacking validation on real clinical data, which undermines the credibility and generalizability of the results.\n- The low resolution oversimplifies the problem, making the results less meaningful for real-world applications.\n- The paper lacks statistical rigor, as it does not report error bars or conduct statistical significance tests.\n- The \"Related Work\" section is insufficient, lacking context and discussion.\n- Key methodological details about the frozen networks used in the loss function are missing, making reproduction difficult despite the promise of a reproducible codebase.\n- There are inconsistencies between the abstract and main tables regarding numerical results.\n\nThe reviewer acknowledges the importance of the core idea and the strong reproducibility practices, but finds the originality to be moderate and the technical contributions undermined by the weak experimental setup. The recommendation is rejection, with suggestions for improvement including evaluation on real datasets, a more thorough related work section, inclusion of all methodological details, and statistical significance testing."
