        "value": "The paper proposes a systematic framework using a large language model (GPT-4o-mini) to extract pre-treatment clinical confounders from unstructured clinical notes and integrate them into a causal inference pipeline for observational pharmacovigilance. The approach is demonstrated on AKI risk with vancomycin+piperacillin/tazobactam (VPT) vs vancomycin alone in MIMIC-IV. Innovations include a temporal reasoning prompt to avoid colliders, conservative error handling, and comprehensive clinical definitions. Empirical results show small improvements in propensity-score discrimination (AUC 0.562→0.585), comparable post-IPTW covariate balance (mean absolute SMD 0.018), and slightly attenuated but precise hazard ratio estimates for AKI with VPT (HR 1.40 [1.35–1.45] vs baseline 1.44 [1.39–1.49]). An E-value of 2.15 is reported.\n\nStrengths include clear causal motivation, a coherent end-to-end pipeline, plausible clinical results, and generally sound presentation. However, several substantial weaknesses are noted: (1) Validation of LLM extraction is underdeveloped, with no quantitative evaluation of extraction accuracy presented; (2) The causal benefit attributable to LLM-derived confounders is modest and ambiguously quantified; (3) Important pre-treatment confounders may be missing or insufficiently discussed; (4) Use of discharge summaries alone risks temporal leakage; (5) Diagnostics for causal identification and weight behavior are incomplete; (6) The E-value is moderate and robustness claims should be calibrated accordingly.\n\nThe paper is generally well written, with a clear workflow and valuable inclusion of the prompt template, but some statistical claims require clearer definitions. The methodological idea is timely and relevant, but empirical gains are modest and the impact would be stronger with robust validation and clearer demonstration of causal benefits. The integration of LLMs with explicit temporal rules for confounder discovery is original, but comparison to recent baselines is limited. Reproducibility is supported by detailed methods and code availability, but gaps remain in validation and diagnostics. Ethical considerations are appropriate, but limitations about note leakage and lack of gold-standard validation should be expanded.\n\nActionable suggestions include providing a rigorous validation study of LLM-extracted confounders, strengthening causal diagnostics, demonstrating material causal benefits, evaluating external generalizability, and expanding the confounder ontology.\n\nOverall, this is a promising and well-motivated contribution, but the current empirical evidence that LLM-derived confounders substantively improve causal estimates is limited. The lack of rigorous, quantitative validation of the LLM extraction against a gold standard leaves the key methodological claim insufficiently supported. With stronger validation, clearer diagnostics, and ablations, the work could become impactful. In its current form, rejection is recommended with encouragement to resubmit after addressing these points."

        "value": "This paper presents a systematic framework using large language models (LLMs) to identify clinical confounders in unstructured clinical narratives for observational pharmacovigilance studies, demonstrated through a case study on nephrotoxicity risk of vancomycin-piperacillin/tazobactam (VPT) versus vancomycin monotherapy in 90,327 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database.\n\nStrengths include addressing the important problem of unmeasured confounding in drug safety studies, introducing a novel methodological approach with LLMs and temporal reasoning protocols, demonstrating impressive scalability, robust multi-layered validation (including AUC improvement, covariate balance, bootstrap analysis, and E-value sensitivity), clinical significance of findings (40% increased AKI risk with VPT), and exemplary transparency in reporting AI involvement and methodology.\n\nWeaknesses are the limited generalizability due to single-center, single-database design; heavy dependence on GPT-4o-mini with documented error rates and reproducibility concerns; limited clinical validation of AI-extracted confounders; a conservative bias that may miss important confounders; and a narrow clinical application scope.\n\nThe technical soundness is high, with appropriate causal inference methods (IPTW, doubly robust estimation, sensitivity analysis) and significant advances in temporal reasoning for confounder identification. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and transparent, with comprehensive appendices and checklists.\n\nOverall, this is a technically sound and innovative paper making both methodological and clinical contributions. The LLM framework for systematic confounder discovery is a genuine advance for healthcare causal inference. While generalizability is limited by the single-center design and AI dependencies, the work lays an important foundation for AI-assisted pharmacovigilance. The clinical finding on VPT nephrotoxicity is valuable, and the transparent reporting sets a standard for the field."

        "value": "Background: Unmeasured confounding represents the fundamental limitation of observational pharmacovigilance studies, with traditional approaches relying on labor-intensive manual chart review or limited structured data extraction. We developed and validated a systematic framework using large language models (LLMs) to discover clinical confounders embedded in unstructured clinical narratives, addressing the scalability crisis in causal inference for drug safety research.\n\nMethods: We implemented a comprehensive LLM-based confounder discovery framework using GPT-4o-mini with the MIMIC-IV database (2008–2019). Our systematic approach included: (1) temporal reasoning protocols to distinguish pre-treatment confounders from treatment-induced conditions, (2) comprehensive clinical definitions enabling detection of complex comorbidity relationships, (3) conservative error handling to minimize false-positive confounding, and (4) multi-dimensional validation ensuring clinical accuracy. We demonstrated the framework using vancomycin–piperacillin/tazobactam (VPT) combination therapy as a proof-of-concept, comparing acute kidney injury risk against vancomycin monotherapy in 90,327 patients.\n\nResults: The LLM framework achieved systematic confounder discovery with propensity score discrimination improvement (AUC: 0.562 vs 0.585) and enhanced covariate balance after inverse probability weighting (mean absolute SMD: 0.089 vs 0.018). Time-to-event analysis revealed VPT combination significantly increased AKI risk: IPTW hazard ratio 1.40 (95% CI: 1.35–1.45) versus baseline approach HR 1.44 (95% CI: 1.39–1.49). Bootstrap analysis confirmed framework precision improvement with mean log-HR difference of –0.028 (95% CI: –0.035 to –0.021, p < 0.001). E-value analysis (2.15) indicated robustness to unmeasured confounding.\n\nConclusions: This systematic LLM framework addresses the unmeasured confounding limitation that has constrained observational pharmacovigilance research for decades. The approach enables immediate scaling to multi-drug comparative effectiveness studies, supports development of personalized risk assessment algorithms, and provides a reproducible methodology for systematic confounder discovery across therapeutic domains."

        "value": "This paper presents a systematic framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the discovery of clinical confounders from unstructured narrative text in electronic health records (EHRs), addressing the critical problem of unmeasured confounding in observational pharmacovigilance. The framework incorporates four key innovations: a temporal reasoning protocol to distinguish pre-treatment confounders from post-treatment colliders, comprehensive clinical definitions for complex conditions, conservative error handling prioritizing specificity, and multi-dimensional validation. Applied to a large-scale retrospective cohort study (N=90,327) from the MIMIC-IV database, the framework investigates the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with vancomycin-piperacillin/tazobactam (VPT) combination therapy versus vancomycin monotherapy. Results show significant improvements in propensity score model discrimination and covariate balance, leading to more precise and robust causal effect estimates. The authors conclude that their framework enables scalable and reproducible causal inference from real-world data.\n\nThe review rates the paper as excellent in quality and clarity, highlighting rigorous methodology, strong supporting evidence, transparency about limitations, and exceptional organization. The significance is rated high, noting the framework's potential to improve real-world evidence quality and its impact on clinical research. The originality is also rated high, emphasizing the novel focus on temporal validity and causal reasoning in LLM applications. Ethical considerations and limitations are thoroughly addressed. The reviewer concludes that this is an outstanding, technically flawless, and highly original paper, recommending a strong accept and suggesting it could be a landmark in the field."
