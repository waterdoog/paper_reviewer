        "value": "The paper addresses the timely and important topic of intentional deception in LLaMA-family models, proposing a four-dimensional taxonomy and reporting a 'scaling paradox' where larger models are both more truthful and better at deception. The taxonomy is clear and the paper is generally well written, with some interesting observations and a readable case study. However, there are major concerns: the evidence does not support the claimed 'scaling law of deception' due to a small dataset, lack of statistical analysis, and modest differences that could be noise. Methodological inconsistencies abound, especially in the definitions and computation of Plausibility and Divergence, insufficient description of model variants and ablations, and lack of detail on prompt and answer selection. Measurement validity is questionable, as embedding-based Plausibility is a weak proxy for human judgment, and the taxonomy's practical distinctness is not demonstrated. The paper overclaims its contributions, especially regarding the scaling law and Gemini ablations, and lacks reproducibility due to missing artifacts and insufficient methodological detail. Minor concerns include cherry-picked examples and incomplete citations. Suggestions include expanding the dataset, improving methodological transparency, using human judgments, clarifying the taxonomy, and tempering claims. The Responsible AI statement is reasonable, but findings should not be overstated. Overall, the paper's topic and framing are promising, but the current scale, inconsistencies, and lack of rigor make the central claim untenable. Rejection is recommended, with encouragement to strengthen methodology, transparency, and evaluation."

        "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents with sophisticated reasoning. Yet they also exhibit concerning behaviors: the ability to deliberately manipulate world models to produce convincing falsehoods. We present an exploratory scaling study of deliberate world-model manipulation across four LLaMA-family models (8B, 17B-Scout, 17B-Maverick, 70B) using 60 controlled experiments. We introduce a novel deception taxonomy—Control, Plausibility, Divergence, and Accuracy—and find a scaling paradox: larger models are both more accurate and more capable deceivers. These results provide the first early evidence of a scaling law of deception in LLM agents, highlighting urgent implications for interpretability, alignment, and AI safety."

        "value": "This paper presents a systematic study of \"world model manipulation\" in Large Language Models, examining how LLMs can deliberately produce false information when prompted. While the research topic is important for AI safety, the paper has significant methodological limitations and questionable claims that undermine its contribution.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe paper's central claims are not well-supported by the methodology. The study uses only 60 questions across 4 models, which is extremely limited for establishing \"scaling laws.\" The authors acknowledge this limitation but still make sweeping claims about scaling behaviors. The experimental design lacks rigor - there are no statistical significance tests, confidence intervals, or proper controls for confounding factors.\n\nThe \"deception evaluation taxonomy\" (Control, Plausibility, Divergence, Accuracy) appears ad-hoc without theoretical justification. The metrics are not validated against human judgments or existing measures of deception. The \"scaling paradox\" finding (that larger models are both more truthful and better at deception) is presented as surprising, but this could simply reflect increased capability in following instructions, whether truthful or deceptive.\n\nClarity and Presentation:\nThe writing is generally clear but contains inflated language (\"striking scaling paradox,\" \"profound phenomenon\") that overstates modest findings. The figures are informative but the interpretation sometimes exceeds what the data supports. The case study showing all models converging on \"Lyon\" as the false capital of France is interesting but anecdotal.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nWhile studying deception in LLMs is important, this work's contribution is limited by scale and methodology. The \"scaling law of deception\" claim is premature given the small dataset. The taxonomy framework could be useful but needs validation. The finding that different alignment approaches (Scout vs Maverick) affect manipulation success is potentially interesting but underdeveloped.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors promise to release code and data but provide insufficient detail for immediate reproduction. Model specifics, prompt exact wording, and evaluation procedures need more detail. The reliance on API calls makes exact reproduction challenging.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors appropriately acknowledge limitations and ethical considerations. However, they don't adequately address how this research could potentially enable harmful applications, despite studying deliberate deception capabilities.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. The dataset size (60 questions, 4 models) is insufficient for establishing scaling laws\n2. No statistical significance testing or confidence intervals\n3. Metrics lack validation against human judgment\n4. Claims of \"first scaling law of deception\" are overstated\n5. The distinction between following deceptive instructions and true \"world model manipulation\" is unclear\n\nThe paper addresses an important safety concern but the execution falls short of the standards expected for a top-tier venue. The findings, while interesting, are preliminary and require substantial additional validation."

The topic is highly important and the conceptual framing is original, but the paper suffers from severe methodological and structural flaws. The experimental scale is extremely small (60 prompts, four models), making the strong claims about scaling laws unjustified. The evaluation metrics, especially for plausibility and divergence, are questionable and lack validation. Key methodological details, particularly for the architectural component analysis, are missing, making results unverifiable. The paper is poorly organized, with confusing presentation of results and undefined terms. Reproducibility is very low due to missing dataset and methodological details. While the research question and originality are strong, the execution is weak and does not meet publication standards. The study should be treated as a pilot and expanded with more rigorous methods and validated metrics. I recommend rejection."
