        "value": "Foundation models for time-series forecasting such as TimesFM promise broad applicability across scientific domains. Yet, zero-shot forecasts often leave systematic residuals and poorly calibrated uncertainties, particularly at long horizons or under seasonal dynamics. We present \\textbf{AgentAdapter-TimesFM}, a lightweight agentic framework that augments a frozen TimesFM backbone with small residual adapters selected through a multi-agent workflow. Our system autonomously proposes, implements, and evaluates adapters—including linear detrend+bias, temporal CNN residuals, and a multi-period exogenous Fourier adapter (EXO-mp). Across three representative datasets, adapters yield dataset- and horizon-dependent effects: on the Electricity Load dataset at a weekly horizon ($H{=}168$), EXO-mp reduces MAE by \\textbf{about 0.78\\%}, while improvements are neutral or negative elsewhere (ECL–24, ETTm1, Niño3.4)."

        "value": "This paper proposes AgentAdapter-TimesFM, a lightweight agentic loop that attaches small residual adapters to a frozen TimesFM backbone. The system is modular, clearly described, and reproducible, with honest reporting of mostly negative results. The only improvement is a modest 0.78% MAE gain on ECL at a weekly horizon; all other adapters and settings are neutral or negative. The approach is computationally cheap and practical for domain scientists. However, there is a serious inconsistency between the results table and the claims in the conclusion, undermining confidence. The novelty is limited, as the methods are well-established and the agentic loop is largely heuristic. Empirical results are weak, with only a small improvement in one setting and no strong statistical support or per-series breakdowns. Baselines are insufficient, lacking comparisons to alternative adaptation strategies. Evaluation scope is limited, with calibration metrics and per-series analyses missing. There are also issues with data preprocessing justification and an incorrect dataset citation. Some components are over-claimed in the conclusion. Overall, while the paper is honest and reproducible, the novelty and empirical impact are limited, there is a notable inconsistency in the claims, and the evaluation lacks strong baselines and calibration analysis. In its current form, it does not meet the bar for acceptance."

Clarify the exact dataset and provide the correct reference.\n- Overstatement in Conclusion: The framework is described as including conformal calibration (page 6, line 214) while earlier sections state probabilistic metrics/conformal elements are supported but not systematically reported and only partially evaluated (pages 4–6)."

        "value": "This paper presents AgentAdapter-TimesFM, a framework for augmenting a frozen, pre-trained time-series foundation model (TimesFM) with lightweight, residual adapters. The core novelty lies in the use of a multi-agent system to autonomously diagnose the base model's forecast errors and then propose, implement, and evaluate suitable adapters. The authors test three types of adapters (linear detrend/bias, temporal CNN, and multi-period exogenous Fourier features) on three scientific time-series datasets. The main empirical finding is that the exogenous Fourier adapter (EXO-mp) yields a modest but reproducible improvement (-0.78% MAE) on the Electricity Load dataset at a weekly forecast horizon, where strong seasonality is present. In other cases, the adapters provide neutral or negative results. The paper is framed as a methodological contribution, demonstrating how an agentic workflow can efficiently test inductive hypotheses in a computationally constrained environment.\n\nThe paper is technically sound and represents a complete and rigorous piece of scientific work. The methodology of applying residual adapters to a frozen backbone is well-motivated and sensible. The experimental design, including the use of rolling-origin evaluation and clear baselines, is appropriate for time-series forecasting. The most commendable aspect is its intellectual honesty: the authors are upfront about the modest nature of their results, clearly presenting both positive and negative outcomes, and do not overclaim their contributions. The analysis correctly concludes that adapters must have an inductive bias that aligns with the residual structure of the problem, a crucial lesson for practitioners. The paper's quality is significantly enhanced by its candidness and focus on deriving insights, rather than just chasing state-of-the-art metrics.\n\nThe paper is a model of clarity. It is exceptionally well-written, with a logical flow from motivation to conclusion. The abstract and introduction perfectly frame the problem, the proposed solution, and the key findings. The methods are described with sufficient detail, and the agentic loop is explained in a simple, interpretable manner. Figure 1 provides a clear, high-level overview of the system architecture. The results are presented concisely in Table 1, and the discussion provides a nuanced interpretation of these results. The writing is professional, precise, and a pleasure to read.\n\nWhile the direct impact on forecasting accuracy is minor, the methodological significance for the Agents4Science community is high. This work provides a concrete and realistic blueprint for how agentic systems can be used to automate parts of the scientific research loop. It moves beyond hype and demonstrates a practical, small-scale application where agents perform a useful, albeit bounded, task: hypothesis testing for model improvement. The key insight—that an agent can use simple diagnostics to propose targeted model modifications—is powerful and generalizable to other models and scientific domains. The paper provides a strong foundation for future work, setting a high standard for reproducibility, interpretability, and honest reporting.\n\nThe paper's originality stems from the novel synthesis of time-series foundation models, parameter-efficient adaptation (residual adapters), and agentic AI for scientific discovery. While components exist in prior work, their combination into a single, cohesive, and automated framework is new. This is the first paper to use a multi-agent system to specifically select and validate residual adapters for a large forecasting model. The concept of an interpretable \"Designer\" agent that uses domain-relevant heuristics (like autocorrelation) is a particularly strong and original contribution.\n\nThe authors have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure their work is reproducible, providing detailed descriptions of datasets, preprocessing, evaluation protocol, hyperparameters, and computational environment. The explicit promise of releasing all code, configuration files, run logs, and a notebook to regenerate results is exemplary. This commitment gives full confidence in the validity of the reported findings.\n\nThe authors provide a dedicated and outstanding \"Limitations\" section, candidly discussing the constraints of their study, including limited compute, small absolute gains, and non-generalizability. The discussion includes thoughtful consideration of the negative societal impacts of misinterpreting or overstating small performance gains. The ethics statement is clear, and the work poses no ethical concerns. The \"AI Authorship\" statement is a transparent addition, well-suited for the conference.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an outstanding paper that should be celebrated as an exemplar for the Agents4Science community. Its primary weakness—the modest size of the empirical improvement—is transformed into a strength through rigorous analysis and intellectual honesty. The true contribution is a robust, reproducible, and insightful methodological framework for agent-driven model improvement. Exceptionally well-written and transparent, it provides a solid foundation for future work. I recommend a strong accept without hesitation."

The paper is well-written and clearly structured, with adequate explanation of methodology and transparency about limitations. However, more detail on agent decision-making would be helpful. The significance is weak, as improvements are extremely modest and highly specific, and the agentic component does not show substantial advantages over traditional methods. The originality lies in the combination of established components rather than fundamental innovation. Reproducibility is strong, with comprehensive details and accessible compute requirements. The authors are honest about limitations and ethical considerations, and the related work section is adequate. Critical issues include questionable practical significance, specificity of results, over-engineered agentic component, and limited evaluation scope. Positive aspects are honest reporting, good reproducibility, novel application, and accessibility.
