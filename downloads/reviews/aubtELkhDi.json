        "value": "The paper introduces SciVerify-Digits, a synthetic diagnostic benchmark for multimodal scientific claim verification, pairing short textual claims with small sets of images from MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN. The benchmark is designed to require numerical and logical reasoning, and the authors evaluate a range of vision–language architectures and a multimodal LLM in zero-shot. The results show that all models struggle to generalize and are not robust to input permutations or adversarial claims, highlighting a lack of reliable, compositional, and permutation-invariant reasoning in current multimodal systems.\n\nStrengths include clear motivation and scope, a controlled diagnostic design that isolates reasoning, systematic evaluation across architectural families, meaningful robustness analyses, and clarity of presentation with supportive figures and tables.\n\nWeaknesses are significant: the novelty is limited relative to existing benchmarks, the connection to real-world scientific verification is overstated, and there is insufficient implementation and evaluation detail for reproducibility and interpretability. The scope of baselines is narrow, missing stronger permutation-invariant and set-reasoning architectures, and the error analysis lacks depth. There are also concerns about the semantic mismatch for Fashion-MNIST and missing compute/statistical reporting.\n\nThe assessment by key dimensions finds the quality and originality incremental, clarity generally good but lacking in technical detail, significance moderate due to the simplicity of tasks, and reproducibility only partially supported. The paper lacks a clear limitations section and misses some relevant related work.\n\nActionable suggestions include specifying the dataset generator comprehensively, disentangling perception from reasoning, expanding baselines, strengthening the M-LLM evaluation, providing statistical rigor and compute reporting, deepening analysis, calibrating relevance to real scientific tasks, and adding explicit limitations and broader impacts sections.\n\nIn conclusion, while the benchmark is potentially useful and the paper is clearly written, the contribution is limited by task simplicity, incomplete methodological detail, narrow baseline coverage, and lack of statistical rigor. The work falls short of acceptance at a high-standards venue in its current form but could be promising with substantial improvements.\n\nOverall recommendation: Borderline reject."

        "value": "This paper introduces SciVerify-Digits, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating multimodal scientific claim verification using simplified visual data (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN) paired with logical/arithmetic claims. The methodology is clear and technically sound, with systematic evaluation of different architectures and appropriate experimental design. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear motivation and adequate experimental details, aiding reproducibility. However, the benchmark is overly simplistic and its connection to real scientific verification is weak. The findings confirm known limitations (poor generalization, lack of permutation invariance) rather than providing new insights. The originality lies in the specific combination of visual datasets with logical claims, but the work is more of an engineering contribution than a conceptual advance. The paper lacks a dedicated limitations section and does not adequately discuss the gap between the benchmark and real-world tasks. The related work section is adequate but could be improved. Major concerns include the benchmark's simplicity, weak connection to scientific reasoning, lack of new insights, missing limitations discussion, and the work feeling more like a negative result. Minor issues include relegation of experimental details to the appendix, lack of error bars or statistical significance testing, and limited discussion of computational requirements. Overall, while technically competent and clearly written, the paper does not make a significant contribution to the field."

        "value": "Verifying scientific claims is a cornerstone of research integrity, yet it poses a significant challenge for automated systems, especially when claims involve multimodal evidence (e.g., text, tables, and figures). While large-scale models have shown promise, their underlying reasoning capabilities remain poorly understood. To address this, we introduce SciVerify-Digits, a new diagnostic benchmark designed to probe the structured reasoning and visual grounding abilities of multimodal models in a controlled, scientific context. Our benchmark synthesizes claims about visual data from MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN, requiring models to perform tasks like counting, arithmetic, and logical inference. We evaluate a suite of models, from simple CNN-based architectures to attention-based fusion models and multimodal large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal systemic failures across all architectures, particularly in generalization, permutation invariance, and robustness to adversarial claims. By providing a detailed failure analysis, including claim-type breakdowns and attention visualizations, this work establishes a framework for diagnosing critical weaknesses in current models and guiding the development of more reliable systems for real-world scientific verification."

The benchmark is well-designed, isolates reasoning skills, and is extensible. The findings are important, showing that even advanced models fail to generalize and are brittle to input changes. The paper is clearly written and organized. However, there are major weaknesses: the specific multimodal LLM evaluated is not named, making results irreproducible; there is no limitations section; and statistical rigor is lacking, with no error bars or confidence intervals reported. Minor issues include undefined metrics and unclear figures. Overall, the paper is valuable and has high impact potential, but acceptance is contingent on addressing the major weaknesses, especially reproducibility and discussion of limitations."
