        "value": "This paper proposes a framework for combining rule mining with neural networks to address the accuracy-interpretability trade-off in tabular classification. The technical approach is sound and clearly described, with two hybrid architectures evaluated. However, the evaluation is limited to synthetic data, which restricts generalizability and practical impact. The performance improvement over baseline is modest (+3.85%), and the use of simple decision stump rules may not capture complex patterns. The work is well-written and organized, with comprehensive implementation details and a clear discussion of limitations. While the paper addresses an important problem, its contribution is incremental, and the lack of real-world evaluation and limited comparison with other interpretable ML approaches reduce its significance. Overall, the paper is technically competent but has significant limitations that prevent it from having substantial impact."

It presents a simple yet powerful idea, supported by clean and compelling experimental evidence. The work is technically sound, clearly presented, and has the potential for significant impact by shifting the perspective on the accuracy-interpretability trade-off. The primary limitation is the lack of evaluation on real-world data, which prevents a \"Strong Accept\" recommendation. However, the strength of the proof-of-concept, the clarity of the contribution, and the adherence to good scientific practices make this a strong candidate for acceptance. The paper provides a solid foundation that will undoubtedly inspire follow-up work."

        "value": "The paper proposes a simple, interpretable-by-design approach that augments MLPs with automatically mined decision-stump rules, introducing two hybrid architectures: HybridConcat and HybridResidual. On a synthetic tabular dataset, HybridConcat achieves a reported 86.32% accuracy vs. 83.12% for an MLP baseline, using only 3 rules with 74.2% sample coverage. The technical pipeline is clear and sound, and the HybridConcat formulation is sensible, showing a small but consistent improvement over the MLP baseline. However, the experimental scope is very limited (single synthetic dataset, no real-world evaluation), and strong baselines for tabular data are missing (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forests, RuleFit, EBM). There is no statistical robustness (single seed, no confidence intervals), and the claimed theoretical contributions are not substantiated. The HybridResidual model is not novel, and the idea of augmenting neural networks with rule features is not new. Clarity is generally good, but important implementation details and synthetic data generator specifics are missing, limiting reproducibility. The significance is low due to the lack of strong real-world results and rigorous comparison to SOTA methods. The contribution is incremental and not sufficiently differentiated from prior work. There are inconsistencies regarding code availability, and the responsible AI statement is appropriate but claims are occasionally overstated. Related work is under-cited and comparative baselines are missing. Actionable suggestions include expanding empirical evaluation, adding strong baselines, improving reproducibility, and calibrating claims. Overall, the idea is clean and promising for synthetic data, but the contribution is incremental and the evaluation too limited for acceptance at a high-standard venue."

        "value": "Deep learning models achieve high accuracy but lack interpretability, while rule-based models are interpretable but often sacrifice performance. This work addresses the accuracy-interpretability trade-off by proposing a novel pipeline that combines rule mining with neural networks for tabular classification. Our approach automatically extracts decision stump rules from training data, selects a sparse subset of effective rules, and integrates them into hybrid neural architectures. We introduce two hybrid models: HybridConcat, which concatenates rule outputs with raw features, and HybridResidual, which combines linear rule combinations with residual MLPs. Our method provides a quantifiable Pareto frontier between interpretability and performance. Experimental results on synthetic tabular data demonstrate that our hybrid models achieve superior performance compared to MLP baselines while using fewer than 6 interpretable rules. Specifically, our HybridConcat model achieves 86.32\\% accuracy (+3.85\\% improvement) with 3 interpretable rules providing 74.2\\% sample coverage. This work contributes a systematic framework for creating interpretable yet accurate models, offering practitioners a principled approach to balance model transparency with predictive power in critical applications requiring explainable AI."
