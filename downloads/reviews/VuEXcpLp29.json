        "value": "This paper presents a novel multi-theoretical framework for analyzing gender framing effects in Large Language Models (LLMs), introducing the dual Binary Framing Index (BFI) and Mosaic Framing Index (MFI) as significant conceptual contributions. The integration of established gender theories and the concept of \"essentialist drift\" are highlighted as original and valuable. However, the paper suffers from critical methodological and empirical weaknesses, particularly in the construction and scaling of the indices, which rely on brittle keyword-based methods and ad-hoc, non-reproducible scaling coefficients. The small sample size further undermines the validity of the conclusions. While the paper is well-written and transparent about its limitations, the methodological flaws are too severe for acceptance. The reviewer recommends rejection in its current form but encourages the authors to revise the methodology or reframe the paper as a theoretical piece, as the core ideas are highly original and promising."

        "value": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate scientific communication, raising concerns about domain-specific gender bias. We propose an exploratory dual-metric framework for analyzing bias across 10 scientific domains using four major LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok). Our Binary Framing Index (BFI) measures stereotyping intensity, while the Mosaic Framing Index (MFI) captures responsiveness to inclusive framing. Both indices use scaled scores after domain-specific adjustment and length normalization. Results suggest notable domain variation: BFI ranges from 11.12 (Introduction) to 25.76 (Social Roles), while MFI spans 11.36 (Technology) to 18.76 (Family). Our preliminary analysis suggests three domain patterns: paradox domains (high stereotyping, high responsiveness), entrenched domains (resistant to interventions), and moderate-intervention domains. These exploratory findings indicate that gender bias in AI-mediated scientific communication may be multi-dimensional and domain-specific, potentially requiring targeted interventions that account for both domain and model characteristics. This study is exploratory in nature and does not test predefined hypotheses. The proposed indices serve as preliminary tools for mapping gender framing tendencies rather than validated psychometric measures. However, our analysis is limited by sample size and lacks statistical validation, requiring further investigation to establish generalizability."

The work is conceptually valuable and introduces original theoretical frameworks and indices, but suffers from significant methodological limitations. The sample size is small, the indices lack proper validation, and the experimental design may confound results due to explicit priming. While the paper is well-written and organized, with clear theoretical exposition and detailed methodology, the lack of statistical rigor and validation undermines the reliability and generalizability of the findings. The work is best viewed as a proof-of-concept rather than a robust empirical study, though it makes a meaningful theoretical contribution to the field."

        "value": "This paper introduces a multi-theoretical framework for analyzing gender framing in LLM outputs, combining Natural Law Theory, Gender Mosaic Theory, and Gender Performativity. It proposes two exploratory metrics (BFI and MFI) and applies them across 10 domains and four LLMs, using 20 prompt pairs. The paper is conceptually original, especially in its dual-metric framing and the notion of 'essentialist drift.' Theoretical integration is strong, and the authors are transparent about limitations, providing reproducibility aids and reporting inter-coder reliability.\n\nHowever, there are major concerns:\n1. The core design confound undermines empirical claims, as outcome metrics are aggregated across prompt types, conflating instruction compliance with model bias.\n2. The metrics and normalization are ad hoc and lack validation against human annotations or external benchmarks. The rationale for domain-specific scaling is not empirically justified, and normalization units are unclear.\n3. The experimental depth is insufficient, with only one sample per prompt per model and no statistical analysis or error estimates.\n4. Reproducibility is incomplete: model versions, generation parameters, and some data details are missing. There are data quality issues in the appendices, including prompt truncations and possible copy/paste errors.\n5. The paper does not sufficiently engage with prior work on LLM bias and established benchmarks, limiting its positioning and assessment of novelty.\n\nDimension-wise: The paper is conceptually intriguing but empirically fragile, with clarity hampered by technical omissions and appendix errors. Its significance is limited by methodological weaknesses, though originality is high in framing. Reproducibility is partial, and ethical considerations are thoughtfully addressed. Citations and related work coverage need strengthening.\n\nRecommendations include redesigning the analysis to isolate essentialist drift, improving metric robustness, removing ad hoc scaling, providing full reproducibility, strengthening evaluation with human and benchmark comparisons, and fixing data integrity issues.\n\nVerdict: The conceptual contribution is promising and limitations are candidly discussed, but central empirical claims are undermined by design confounds, ad hoc scaling, limited sampling, and reproducibility/data-quality issues. In its current exploratory form, it falls short of the rigor needed for acceptance."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Confounding from directive prompts: binary prompts instruct traditional framings; mosaic prompts instruct inclusive framings. Without condition-specific drift measures (e.g., BFI in mosaic-only), indices largely reflect compliance, not bias.\n- Unclear and inconsistent scaling: reported score magnitudes (e.g., BFI 11–26) do not follow directly from counts/word × 0.8–1.3 domain multipliers; pre-/post-scaling ranges are inconsistent with length normalization.\n- No replication or statistical uncertainty: single outputs per prompt-model, no control of sampling randomness or decoding parameters, no variance estimates.\n- Measurement validity gaps: BFI pronoun detection omits common markers (his, hers, male/female, man/woman), likely biasing counts; lexicons/regex not provided for verification.\n- Data integrity concern: In Appendix B.9 (page 17), Claude’s mosaic output appears identical to its binary output, suggesting a logging/copy error.\n- Overstated reproducibility: Claims of open code/access and documented model parameters contradict missing code and absent inference settings.\n- Heuristic domain classification: 'Paradox/Entrenched/Moderate' labels (Table 1, page 6) presented without a formal clustering method or statistical criteria.\n- Domain multipliers derived from a small, under-specified pilot (20 responses per domain) risk injecting subjective scaling that distorts cross-domain comparability."
