        "value": "This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning system for drug synergy prediction with patient-specific pharmacokinetic constraints. While the problem is important and the multi-agent approach has merit, there are significant concerns that limit the paper's contribution. The experimental setup lacks proper baselines, relying on outdated comparisons, and the validation methodology is insufficient, using only 6 literature-validated combinations. The claimed efficacy gain is based on a poorly defined metric, and there are inconsistencies in the mathematical formulations. The reward function design appears ad-hoc and unjustified. The paper is poorly organized, with dense jargon, inconsistent notation, confusing results presentation, unclear architecture explanations, and poor figure quality. The significance of the contributions is questionable, as the multi-agent formulation and patient-aware component do not provide clear advantages or novelty. Reproducibility is undermined by missing implementation details and lack of hyperparameter justification. Ethical concerns arise from the heavy reliance on AI-generated content without proper human oversight. Additional issues include lack of discussion of limitations, inadequate clinical translation discussion, weak comparisons, and insufficient statistical testing. Overall, the paper fails to provide convincing evidence for its approach, with overcomplicated methodology, insufficient evaluation, and poor presentation quality."

        "value": "This paper introduces a patient-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for drug synergy discovery, integrating drug pair selection, dosing adaptation, and safety via PK/PD penalties. The system demonstrates strong empirical results on a large combined dataset, with high validation R², low RMSE, high AUROC, and a notable 'novel hit-rate.' The architecture is modular and includes curriculum learning, prioritized replay, and ensemble recalibration, with comprehensive reporting and explicit discussion of limitations.\n\nHowever, there are major concerns:\n1. The 'patient-aware' claims are overstated, as patient covariates are synthetic and do not influence synergy labels, limiting the clinical relevance of the results.\n2. The PK/PD modeling is oversimplified, under-specified, and lacks physical consistency, undermining claims of clinical-grade safety integration.\n3. There are internal inconsistencies in state dimensionality, learning paradigms, and integration of synergy predictors, leading to methodological confusion.\n4. Evaluation metrics and claims are overreaching, with undefined composite metrics, unclear validation criteria, and potential data leakage due to insufficient dataset split controls.\n5. Reproducibility is limited by underspecified environment details and lack of code at submission.\n\nWhile the paper is original in embedding patient-aware constraints and modularizing agents, the evidence does not convincingly demonstrate a clinically meaningful advance. The review suggests substantial revisions: clarifying PK/PD modeling, rigorously defining metrics, unifying methodology, improving evaluation rigor, strengthening validation, and ensuring reproducibility. The verdict is that, despite promising directions, the paper's conceptual, methodological, and evaluation weaknesses preclude acceptance at this time."

We introduce a patient-aware, reinforcement-learning-augmented multi-agent system that re-imagines discovery as an active, closed-loop search over both drug pairs and individual pharmacology. Where traditional QSAR and even recent deep-learning baselines treat synergy as a static regression problem and thus plateau at dataset-wide RMSE near 0.06, our environment embeds patient-specific clearance, BSA, and toxicity thresholds directly into the reward. A factorized set of agents—Synergy Scout, Dose Adapter, and Safety Sentinel—explore the joint space via distributed deep Q-networks with prioritized replay, while an ensemble of analysts continuously recalibrates predictions against clinical outcomes. Across more than one million drug–patient combinations, this design delivers a validation R² of 0.913 and an 83.2% accuracy on literature-validated pairs, translating to a 722% efficacy gain over DeepSynergy and a 15% AUROC lift over the best prior multi-agent framework. The resulting system is not only more accurate but also intrinsically interpretable, providing transparent rationales that monolithic pipelines cannot."

        "value": "This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system for predicting synergistic drug combinations, with a novel and crucial focus on patient-specific pharmacology and clinical feasibility. The work tackles the immense combinatorial challenge of drug discovery by framing it as a dynamic, closed-loop search, a significant departure from traditional static regression or post-hoc filtered approaches.\n\nQuality: The submission is of very high technical quality. The core idea of embedding pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) constraints—such as creatinine clearance, body surface area, and age-related toxicity thresholds—directly into the reward function of the RL agents is both innovative and exceptionally well-executed. This design choice directly addresses a major failing of prior work, which often proposes drug doses that are clinically infeasible. The experimental validation is rigorous and extensive. The authors benchmark their system against a comprehensive set of baselines, including monolithic deep learning models and previous multi-agent systems. The results are outstanding, showing not just incremental gains but order-of-magnitude improvements on key metrics (e.g., a 7-fold error reduction vs. DeepSynergy) and, most impressively, a massive leap in the feasibility of recommended doses (97.3% vs. ~65-71% for prior MAS). The ablation studies are thorough and convincingly demonstrate the individual contributions of the key architectural components (RL, patient-awareness, and the safety agent). The work is a complete and compelling piece of research.\n\nClarity: The paper is largely well-written, with a clear and motivating introduction, a comprehensive related work section that precisely situates the contribution, and a very clear presentation of experiments and results. However, the main text's methodology section (Section 3) is a significant weak point. It is disjointed, presenting a series of different formalisms (policy gradients, DQNs, gradient boosting, etc.) without a clear, unified narrative of how they constitute the final system. This makes it difficult for the reader to grasp the exact architecture from the main text alone. Fortunately, this confusion is largely resolved by the excellent pseudo-code (Algorithm 3) and detailed descriptions in the appendix, which clarify that the core is a distributed DQN system. While this is a notable flaw in the presentation, it is rectifiable and does not invalidate the technical substance of the work.\n\nSignificance: The significance of this work is exceptionally high. If the results hold up to scrutiny and can be translated into practice, this system represents a paradigm shift in computational pharmacology. By co-optimizing for synergy and patient-specific safety, the system generates hypotheses that are not only scientifically interesting but also immediately more viable for clinical translation. The reported 34% \"novel hit rate\" on combinations validated against recent literature is a testament to the system's powerful exploratory capabilities. This work has the potential to substantially accelerate the discovery of personalized combination therapies, a critical goal in areas like oncology. Others will undoubtedly build upon this framework of integrating real-world clinical constraints directly into the discovery loop.\n\nOriginality: The paper is highly original. While multi-agent systems and RL have been applied to this problem before, the explicit and deeply integrated modeling of patient-specific pharmacology within the reward structure is a novel contribution. The architectural decomposition into specialized agents (Synergy Scout, Dose Adapter, Safety Sentinel) is an elegant and interpretable design that moves beyond monolithic or simple two-agent systems. The combination of curriculum learning, continuous online fine-tuning, and an adaptive ensemble further distinguishes this work from prior static pipeline approaches.\n\nReproducibility: The authors have gone to great lengths to ensure reproducibility. The appendices provide extensive details on the datasets, preprocessing steps, model architectures, and a full list of hyperparameters. The inclusion of clear pseudo-code for the main training loop is particularly valuable. The authors also state their intention to release the code and data, which is commendable. An expert in the field should be able to reproduce these results with the information provided.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors provide a very honest and thorough discussion of the work's limitations in the appendix. They correctly identify the \"in vitro to in vivo\" gap, simplifications in their pharmacodynamic model, and the need for more granular adverse event prediction. This transparency is a major strength. The work's focus on safety and clinical feasibility demonstrates a responsible approach to the ethical considerations of applying AI in medicine.\n\nConclusion: This is a groundbreaking paper that sets a new state of the art in AI-driven drug synergy prediction. It addresses a critical flaw in previous work by making patient safety and clinical feasibility a first-class citizen in the optimization process. The technical approach is novel, the results are exceptionally strong, and the potential impact is immense. Despite a confusingly written methodology section in the main text, the overall quality and significance of the work are undeniable. This paper is an exemplar of the kind of high-impact, interdisciplinary research that the Agents4Science conference aims to attract. It earns my strongest possible recommendation for acceptance."
