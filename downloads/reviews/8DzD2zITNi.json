        "value": "This paper presents a rigorous and novel framework for diagnosing and attributing model-dependent biases in gravitational-wave (GW) parameter inference, applying it to the high-mass binary black hole merger event GW231123. The authors analyze posterior samples from five different state-of-the-art waveform models, demonstrating significant discrepancies in key astrophysical parameters. The core contribution is a \"Physics-Informed Discrepancy Decomposition\" method, which combines statistical divergence metrics (JSD, Wasserstein distance), high-dimensional visualization (UMAP), and a systematic analysis of physically motivated parameter subspaces. This allows the authors to not only quantify disagreements but also link them to specific physical approximations in the waveform models, such as the treatment of spin precession and higher-order modes. The paper's main conclusion is stark and impactful: for a complex event like GW231123, systematic uncertainties from waveform model choice dominate statistical errors, precluding any robust astrophysical constraints with the current models.\n\nThe technical quality of this submission is exceptionally high. The methodology is sound, well-motivated, and thoroughly executed. The proposed framework is a significant methodological contribution, intelligently combining existing tools into a novel, structured approach that provides deep, interpretable insights into a complex, high-dimensional problem. The claims are strongly supported by the experimental results, and the work is presented as a complete and polished piece of research. While the main finding is a \"negative\" result (the inability to robustly constrain parameters), this is an extremely valuable and important contribution in the context of precision science like GW astronomy.\n\nThe paper is a model of clarity, exceptionally well-written, with a logical flow and precise, unambiguous language. The organization is excellent, and the methods section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the analysis pipeline. The results are presented logically, and the figures are well-designed and informative. There are no weaknesses in clarity.\n\nThe work is highly significant for both the gravitational-wave astronomy community and any field dealing with inference from complex computational models. The problem of model-dependent biases is a critical roadblock for GW astronomy, and this paper provides a powerful diagnostic tool that can be immediately adopted by other researchers. By attributing discrepancies to specific physical effects, this work provides crucial feedback for waveform model developers. The conclusion that waveform choice can dominate inference for certain events is a crucial message that will shape future analyses in the field.\n\nThe paper is highly original, synthesizing established techniques in a novel, physics-informed framework. The primary novelty lies in the \"Physics-Informed Discrepancy Decomposition\" framework, which moves beyond simple 1D posterior comparisons to a multi-faceted analysis including high-dimensional clustering and multi-dimensional subspace divergences. This is a major conceptual advance.\n\nThe paper appears to be fully reproducible, with methods described in great detail and all code, data, and analysis files available in the supplementary material. The authors are forthright about the limitations of current astrophysical inference for this type of event and do not overstate their claims. There are no ethical concerns.\n\nOverall, this is an outstanding paper that meets the highest standards of scientific research. It addresses a critical problem with a novel, powerful, and technically sound methodology. The results are significant, the conclusions are well-supported, and the manuscript is written with exceptional clarity. This work not only provides a crucial analysis of the specific event GW231123 but also delivers a methodological framework that will be of broad utility to the GW community and beyond. It is a clear and enthusiastic recommendation for acceptance and has the potential to be a highly influential paper."

Differences may reflect priors/pipelines, not only waveform physics.\n- High-dimensional KDE (up to 6D) used for JSD without reporting sample sizes, bandwidth matrices, cross-validation, or bootstrap; potential instability/overstatement of divergence.\n- No uncertainty quantification for JSD/Wasserstein (e.g., via bootstrapping) and no sensitivity analyses (bandwidths, UMAP hyperparameters).\n- Potential neglect of posterior sample weights (common in GW posteriors), which can bias KDEs and divergence estimates.\n- UMAP used to argue clustering but without robustness checks or embedding-quality metrics; centroid coordinates treated as quantitative separation despite UMAP’s non-metric nature.\n- Model capabilities/naming ambiguities (e.g., IMRPhenomXO4a) and lack of documented settings (higher modes, precession options) limit technical interpretability.\n- No verification that inferred posteriors lie within the calibration/domain-of-validity of each waveform model (e.g., NRSur7dq4).\n- Redshift comparisons lack explicit cosmology/specification; potential inconsistency across models."

        "value": "This paper addresses an important and timely problem—model-dependent biases in gravitational wave inference for high-mass, precessing binary black hole systems—using a multi-pronged analysis of posterior samples from five waveform models. The strengths include clear framing, sensible methodology (1D divergences, UMAP, subspace-wise JSD), and strong empirical signals of model disagreement, all presented with clarity and informative visuals.\n\nHowever, there are major methodological concerns that undermine the main conclusion. The most critical is the lack of prior harmonization and harmonized inference settings, which means that observed divergences may reflect differences in priors or pipelines rather than true model physics. The use of standard KDE for bounded and periodic variables is inappropriate and can distort results, especially in high-dimensional spaces, and there is no uncertainty quantification for the divergence metrics. The UMAP analysis lacks robustness checks, and sample-count imbalances are not addressed. Criteria for parameter robustness are inconsistently applied, and the analysis does not validate models against the data (e.g., via Bayes factors or posterior predictive checks). Essential details for reproducibility are missing, and the methodological novelty is incremental.\n\nMinor concerns include tangential references and potentially overbroad conclusions about parameter robustness. The reviewer provides actionable suggestions for addressing these issues, including prior harmonization, appropriate density modeling, robustness checks, data-facing validation, and comprehensive reporting of run details.\n\nOverall, while the paper is well-structured and tackles an important problem, the methodological flaws and missing controls are significant enough that the reviewer cannot recommend acceptance in its current form."

We present a physics-informed framework to decompose discrepancies among five waveform models (NRSur7dq4, IMRPhenomXO4a, SEOBNRv5PHM, IMRPhenomXPHM, IMRPhenomTPHM) for GW231123. Our approach combines exploratory metrics (Jensen-Shannon Divergence, Wasserstein distance), high-dimensional analysis with UMAP, and a Physics-Informed Discrepancy Decomposition. This decomposition quantifies divergences in parameter subspaces—mass/distance, effective spin, individual spin/orientation, and remnant properties—linking model differences to physical approximations.\n\nWe find substantial disagreements in inferred component masses, effective spin, and redshift, with UMAP separating models into distinct clusters. Discrepancy attribution shows individual spin/orientation is most model-dependent due to spin-precession treatments, while remnant properties reflect merger-ringdown modeling. Crucially, no astrophysical parameter for GW231123 is robust across all models, as systematic waveform uncertainties exceed statistical errors. Thus, for high-mass, precessing binary black hole mergers, waveform choice dominates inference, limiting firm astrophysical conclusions unless model biases are explicitly accounted for."

        "value": "This paper presents a physics-informed framework for analyzing discrepancies between gravitational wave waveform models in the context of the GW231123 event. However, it suffers from fundamental methodological problems, including arbitrary parameter grouping without rigorous physical justification, lack of theoretical foundation for subspace choices, and arbitrary robustness criteria. The analysis concludes that no parameter is robust, raising questions about the utility of the approach. Technical concerns include the limited scientific insight from UMAP analysis, lack of statistical uncertainty quantification for Jensen-Shannon Divergence, insufficient discussion of whether discrepancies reflect genuine uncertainties, and no validation against synthetic sources. The core finding is not novel, and the proposed framework is not sufficiently developed or validated. While the paper is generally well-written and provides implementation details, its fully AI-generated nature raises concerns about the depth of understanding, critical analysis, and appropriateness for scientific venues. Specific technical issues include potentially overstated conclusions, lack of discussion on systematic uncertainty ranges, no comparison to established methods, and unclear links to known approximation schemes. The paper also lacks context regarding existing systematic uncertainty treatments and engagement with broader literature. Overall, despite addressing a relevant problem and presenting interesting visualizations, the methodological flaws, lack of novel insights, and concerns about AI-generated content without adequate human oversight make it unsuitable for acceptance at a high-quality venue."
