        "value": "Background: Long-duration space exploration exposes biological systems to numerous stressors, necessitating robust research into their molecular and physiological effects. Ground-based microgravity simulators are essential tools, yet their biological fidelity compared to true spaceflight is poorly characterized, leading to inconsistent findings and suboptimal resource allocation. \nMethods: This study employs a three-phase, integrated approach to address this challenge. First, we con\nducted a systematic meta-analysis of existing spaceflight omics data from NASA’s GeneLab to define a quantitative Biological Fidelity Score (BFS). Second, we performed prospective multi-omics validation using diverse human cell models (osteocytes, lymphocytes, cardiac organoids) representing a spectrum of intrinsic biological characteristics. Finally, we developed and validated a Random Forest\n machine learning model to predict simulation fidelity based on these characteristics.\n Results: Our analysis revealed a conserved core stress response to spaceflight across multiple species, centered on oxidative stress and DNA damage pathways. We also identified pronounced tissue-specific adaptations, particularly in hepatic metabolism and a systemic desynchronization of circadian rhythms. Crucially, the fidelity of ground simulators varied dramatically, with BFS values ranging from\n high (>0.75) in specific cellular contexts to extremely low (<0.05) in cross-species comparisons. Our predictive model successfully identified mechanosensitivity and system complexity as key determinants of simulation fidelity. \nConclusion: This work provides the first data-driven framework for quantitatively assessing the fidelity of microgravity simulators. The resulting predictive model and decision matrix offer a powerful tool to optimize experimental design, reduce research costs,\nand ensure that critical spaceflight validation is prioritized for the most pressing biological questions, thereby accelerating discoveries vital for the future of human space exploration."

        "value": "The paper addresses an important and timely question in space biology by proposing a Biological Fidelity Score (BFS) to assess the fidelity of ground-based microgravity simulators relative to true spaceflight, combining meta-analysis, prospective multi-omic validation, and predictive modeling. The strengths include the significance of the problem, an ambitious integrated approach, practical decision-support framing, and clear writing. However, there are major concerns: (1) insufficient methodological specificity and missing data for core claims (BFS definition, meta-analysis details, prospective experiment substantiation, and clarity of model-predicted values); (2) the predictive model is unvalidated and non-reproducible, relying on mock data without real performance metrics or robust methodology; (3) empirical claims are based on schematic figures without evidentiary support; (4) reproducibility gaps, as no data or BFS computation code is released; (5) some claims lack proper citations or grounding. The discussion acknowledges some limitations but does not address uncertainty-aware recommendations or risks of misapplication. Actionable recommendations include formalizing and releasing BFS code, fully documenting the meta-analysis, substantiating experiments with data and statistical analysis, validating the predictive model on real data, justifying thresholds, aligning citations, and comparing BFS to alternative measures. Overall, while the problem and framework are compelling, the submission lacks the empirical detail, data, and validated modeling required for technical soundness and reproducibility, and thus does not meet the standards for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper presents a decision matrix framework for selecting appropriate microgravity simulation platforms based on biological system characteristics. The methodology combines meta-analysis, prospective experiments, and machine learning modeling, using established metrics for the Biological Fidelity Score (BFS). While technically sound in principle, the work relies heavily on existing NASA GeneLab data and does not present new experimental validation. Prospective experiments are described but only mock data are used, and the Random Forest model validation lacks rigorous cross-validation or external validation. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear methodology and figures, but the distinction between results from actual experiments and literature synthesis is unclear. The research addresses an important problem and the decision matrix could be valuable, but its impact is limited by the lack of experimental validation and reliance on simulated data. The framework is original in its integration of meta-analysis and predictive modeling, though individual components have been explored previously. Reproducibility is limited by the absence of real data, and the meta-analysis protocol could be more detailed. Ethical considerations and limitations are discussed, but the framework's own limitations regarding validation and generalizability could be better addressed. Related work is cited appropriately, though comparison to existing simulator selection approaches could be more comprehensive. Critical issues include the lack of new experimental data, reliance on synthetic data for machine learning, and unclear presentation of prospective validation results. Overall, the framework is a promising starting point but requires empirical validation with real data to demonstrate effectiveness."
