        "value": "This paper presents TF-Boids: Survival of the Useful, a framework that combines Boids-style local coordination rules with evolutionary selection in a tool-building multi-agent ecosystem. While the work addresses an interesting question about emergent coordination from simple decentralized rules, there are several significant concerns that limit its contribution.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe paper suffers from several technical issues. The mathematical formulation of the Boids rules (Section 3.2) appears ad-hoc and lacks theoretical grounding - the preference functions and their linear combination seem arbitrary rather than principled. The Tool Complexity Index (TCI), while clearly defined, is a static measure that may not capture meaningful tool quality or utility. The experimental design is limited in scope (only 10 agents over 10 rounds) and lacks proper statistical analysis with confidence intervals or significance testing. The results show modest differences between conditions that may not be statistically meaningful.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is reasonably well-written but suffers from organizational issues. The extensive appendix (pages 24-40) containing agent reflections and prompt templates overwhelms the main content and suggests the work may be more of an engineering exercise than a scientific contribution. The connection between the Boids framework and tool-building is not always clear, and some design choices appear unmotivated.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nWhile the intersection of swarm intelligence and multi-agent tool creation is interesting, the empirical findings are limited. The main result - that Boids rules produce more modular, smaller tools - is not particularly surprising and the practical implications are unclear. The work doesn't advance our theoretical understanding of emergent coordination or provide actionable insights for multi-agent system design.\n\nOriginality:\nThe combination of Boids rules with evolutionary tool-building is novel, but the individual components are well-established. The adaptation of spatial Boids rules to cognitive coordination is interesting but not deeply explored theoretically.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe paper provides detailed algorithmic descriptions and extensive implementation details in the appendix. However, the reliance on LLM agents makes true reproducibility challenging, as model behavior may vary across runs and versions.\n\nExperimental Limitations:\nThe experimental evaluation is quite limited - only three domains, small agent populations, and short time horizons. The comparison is primarily against simple baselines rather than other coordination mechanisms. The metrics focus primarily on tool complexity rather than actual task performance or utility.\n\nMissing Related Work:\nThe paper could better connect to the broader literature on multi-agent coordination, tool use in AI systems, and emergent behavior in artificial societies. The relationship to existing work on multi-agent reinforcement learning and cooperative AI is underdeveloped.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some figures and tables could be clearer\n- The extensive appendix suggests the core contribution may be thin\n- Statistical analysis is lacking throughout\n\nThe work represents an interesting exploration but falls short of making a significant scientific contribution. The empirical findings are limited, the theoretical framework is underdeveloped, and the practical implications are unclear."

(5), and component scales for Psep/Palign/Pcoh are not normalized prior to weighted combination (p.4–5).\n- Inconsistency between the mathematical alignment rule (Eq. 4–5, success by tool count) and the alignment pseudo-algorithm that uses TCI, pass rates, and adoption (Appendix Algorithm 1; p.10–11).\n- Fitness/selection mismatch: narrative claims societal-level fitness, but implementation selects by per-agent average TCI, a complexity proxy vulnerable to gaming and not necessarily tied to utility/adoption (p.3 vs. p.5–6).\n- TCI definition divergence: main text defines TCI as sum of components (p.5–6), but Appendix TCI-Lite v4 multiplies by a quality_gate not introduced in the main section (p.11).\n- Testing methodology is explicitly extremely lenient by design (p.39–40), undermining the interpretability of pass rates and retention metrics used to support claims.\n- Experimental statistical reporting: no error bars, confidence intervals, or hypothesis tests are presented; the checklist’s claim of significance reporting is inconsistent with the body (p.42–44).\n- Evolution details are under-specified (representation for crossover/mutation, rates, schedule) and inconsistent with reported outcomes (population growth in Table 2 vs. elimination-and-replacement in §3.3; differing initial population sizes) (p.5, p.8).\n- Baseline confusion: §3.1 describes a self-reflective baseline, while §4.2 disables self-reflection in both conditions; this redefines the baseline without a clear justification (p.3–4 vs. p.7).\n- Key analysis metrics (e.g., center drift rate, unique pattern ratio, agent complexity coherence) appear in tables but are not defined in Methods, reducing reproducibility (p.14–23).\n- Code template issues in prompts (e.g., if name == 'main' with typographic quotes and missing underscores) and brittle import path requirements in tests may introduce avoidable failures or non-portability (p.39)."

        "value": "This paper introduces TF-Boids: Survival of the Useful, a sandbox for multi-agent tool-building that adapts the Boids triad (separation–alignment–cohesion) into cognitive local rules for agent design, with an evolutionary selection mechanism. The work is conceptually clear, with explicit mathematical formalization, detailed pseudo-algorithms, and comprehensive logging of ecosystem metrics. The infrastructure is transparent, and the limitations are candidly discussed.\n\nHowever, the evaluation is fundamentally undermined by intentionally lenient testing, which makes reported pass rates and claims about reliability and survival unconvincing. The evolutionary selection is based on a Tool Complexity Index (TCI) that incentivizes code bloat rather than genuine utility or composability, misaligning the fitness signal with the paper’s stated goals. Claims about increased composability are not directly demonstrated, and Boids often shows lower test pass rates than the baseline. The experiments are small-scale, lack statistical rigor, and contain inconsistencies and editorial issues. There is also an anonymity breach in the Related Work section.\n\nThe originality lies in the specific sandbox and measurement suite, but the approach is conceptually incremental relative to prior work. Reproducibility is improved by detailed pseudo-code and templates, but the absence of code artifacts and the lenient testing regime limit verifiability. Ethical risks are minimal, but the mismatch between claimed usefulness and actual metrics should be made explicit.\n\nActionable suggestions include aligning fitness with adoption-weighted utility and robust task metrics, strengthening tests, reporting composition depth and adoption graphs, providing multi-seed runs with statistical analysis, clarifying experimental setups, fixing editorial and anonymity issues, and releasing code and analysis scripts.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a promising and well-instrumented framework, but its evaluation does not convincingly support its claims. Stronger, task-grounded evaluation and a utility-aligned selection signal are needed for impact. In its current form, I recommend rejection."

        "value": "How much collective intelligence can emerge from simple, decentralized rules without heavy, predefined workflows? We explore this question through a framework that couples Boids-style local coordination with explicit evaluation and selection in a survival-driven, tool-building ecology. Agents interact via three local rules—cohesion, separation, and alignment—and follow an observe–reflect–build loop to generate and refine tools within an ecosystem that includes automated tests, shared registries, and a Tool Complexity Index capturing code, interface, and compositional sophistication. Positioned as a preliminary study, this work treats evolution as a complementary lens: local rules catalyze collaboration and modularity, while selective feedback favors strategies that persist across generations. Across text analysis, data science, and simulation modeling tasks, evolutionary-Boids societies increase throughput and balance contributions among agents while maintaining reliability, though current prompting tends to suppress deep tool composition. The resulting systems produce more and self-contained tools rather than extended pipelines, suggesting a breadth-first mode of exploration in its current setup. Overall, the framework offers an early step toward understanding how simple, local interactions and evolutionary pressure together shape the emergence of organized, evolving agent ecosystems."

The introduction and related works are well written and thorough. Section 3 also provides a reasonable mathematical formulation of the interactions. I also like using creative writing, data science and research assistant as tasks. \n\nSection 4 on the experiments is missing some important information. There is sparse information on what exactly are benchmark tasks (e.g. what are the creative writing queries, is it an existing benchmark, etc.) and how they are evaluated. This makes it harder to interpret how robust the improvements are. I appreciate that the baseline choice is reasonable. \n\nA more detailed findings section and interpretation of the results and key insights would also be helpful. For example, ablate each component of agent interaction and see how that affects outcomes. \n\nOverall, I would say that the idea and setup is interesting and creative (comparable to a Neurips paper), but the experimental execution is more preliminary and can be more indepth."

        "value": "This paper introduces TF-Boids, a novel framework for studying the emergence of collective intelligence in decentralized, tool-building agent societies. The authors adapt the classic Boids rules (separation, alignment, cohesion) from spatial coordination to the cognitive domain of software development, coupling these with evolutionary selection to explore the rise of modular, composable, and specialized tool ecosystems. Key contributions include: (1) a unified framework combining local interaction rules with global evolutionary pressure; (2) metrics and infrastructure for analyzing agent-driven tool construction, centered on the Tool Complexity Index (TCI); and (3) empirical analysis showing that Boids-style rules foster modularity and evolutionary selection promotes specialization and capability growth.\n\nStrengths:\n- The paper is highly original and significant, creatively mapping Boids' rules to functional niche specialization, strategy imitation, and collaborative reuse. It moves beyond traditional multi-agent systems research into generative collaboration, offering a new paradigm for studying multi-agent alignment and digital institutions.\n- Technically strong, with clear mathematical formulations and a nuanced TCI metric that evaluates agent-generated code on multiple dimensions. The experimental design is rigorous, with clear and convincing results supporting the central claims.\n- Exceptionally well-written, organized, and transparent, with a strong commitment to reproducibility. The authors provide detailed mathematical formulas, TCI composition, pseudo-code, and full prompt templates, enabling replication and extension.\n- The \"Scope and Limitations\" section is candid and thorough, identifying key constraints and demonstrating a mature understanding of the research context.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Experiments are conducted with a small number of agents (10) over a short time (10 rounds). Larger-scale, longer-term experiments would strengthen claims about ecosystem evolution.\n- Evaluation is based on internal metrics (TCI) rather than external utility. Integrating downstream tasks would allow assessment of practical performance gains.\n- The fitness function is simple (average TCI of created tools). Exploring more complex fitness landscapes could yield richer ecosystem dynamics.\n\nRecommendation:\nThis is an outstanding, landmark paper with a novel framework, rigorous experiments, and significant results. Its creative synthesis, technical depth, and exceptional clarity and reproducibility make it a model for the field. It is a must-accept for the Agents4Science conference and is likely to become highly cited and influential."
