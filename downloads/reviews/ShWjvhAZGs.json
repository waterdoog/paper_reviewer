        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Synthetic data detection criteria are weakly justified: treating summation to 100% and near-even ratios as a diagnostic signature is methodologically unsound for mixtures (pp. 4–6).\n- Statistical claims (e.g., z-score 43.8; p < 0.001) lack a clearly defined reference distribution for the specific tri-component ratios and do not follow from the provided heuristic Synthetic Score (Supplement Eq. 1).\n- Technical mischaracterization of methods: classical MD with CHARMM36 cannot provide quantum-mechanical insights or UV-Vis spectra as implied (Fig. 1 caption on p. 5; Supplement p. 13); NVIDIA Modulus usage is not coherently tied to molecular/spectroscopic properties.\n- Ambiguity in model definitions and targets: AUROC = 0.87 (p. 6) reported without specifying the classification task; R^2 = 0.94 across “312 independent formulation trials” (p. 5) is undefined in a purely computational setting.\n- Inconsistent resource and availability statements: 12 hours total processing time (footnote on p. 2) vs 216.8 hours in Table 2 (p. 6); code/data both on GitHub (p. 8) and “available upon request” (p. 12).\n- Use of ChEMBL/PubChem for NMR/FTIR as primary sources is not substantiated and is atypical (Supplement p. 13).\n- Derivation of SPF/CMC/MIC predictions for novel PGSLs from heterogeneous databases is under-specified (features, model types, calibration, leakage controls), yet precise CIs are reported (pp. 2, 6, 12–13).\n- The claim of high-precision detection of synthetic Dirichlet artifacts (precision 0.98, recall 0.95; p. 7) lacks dataset definitions, baselines, and robustness checks.\n- The TFEI metric lacks uncertainty propagation from predicted inputs and uses equal weighting without justification (Supplement Eq. 3, pp. 6–7, 12).\n- Several tool/system names in the 10-tool ecosystem (Table on p. 4) are not technically described, limiting reproducibility and assessment of methodological soundness."

        "value": "This paper introduces an 'Architectural Immune System' for autonomous scientific agents, enforcing mandatory self-falsification through multi-layer anomaly detection, pattern analysis, and provenance/code inspection. A case study in materials discovery (cosmetics biosurfactants: phenylpropanoid-grafted sophorolipids, PGSLs) demonstrates the system's ability to catch a silent failure, reject 'perfect' ratios, and pivot to database-grounded optimization. The final outputs are computationally predicted performance metrics and an 'authentic' ratio derived from a hybrid scheme. The paper emphasizes research integrity, provides a code link, and claims strong detection performance on a controlled dataset.\n\nStrengths include addressing a timely problem (preventing synthetic/fabricated results in agentic science), a clear narrative of a real failure case, a concrete three-layer validation architecture, attempts at quantification (precision/recall, AUROC, R2, TFEI), ethical framing, and open-source code.\n\nHowever, the evaluation of the 'immune system' is limited and narrow, focusing on a single failure mode without systematic benchmarking against diverse synthetic artifacts or real-world contaminated datasets. Baselines are missing, making it difficult to credit performance claims. Some numerical claims are questionable or under-justified, with inconsistencies in reported statistics and insufficient evidence for data provenance and autonomy metrics. The materials case study lacks experimental validation, relying solely on computational predictions. Modeling and pipeline details are opaque, with vague descriptions of components and insufficient methodological detail for reproducibility. Related work on data validation and anomaly detection is not thoroughly discussed, weakening the novelty claim.\n\nActionable suggestions include broadening the evaluation with diverse artifacts and baselines, clarifying data provenance, detailing the hybrid modeling approach, tempering claims or adding experimental validation, and expanding discussion of related work.\n\nIn conclusion, while the core idea is compelling and the transparency about failure is exemplary, the empirical support is too narrow and several claims are under-specified. The paper does not currently meet the bar for rigorous, high-impact validation expected at a premier venue. With stronger benchmarking, clearer methodology, and experimental or external validation, the work could become influential.\n\nOverall recommendation: Borderline reject."

        "value": "We introduce the ’Architectural Immune System,’ a framework for trustworthy autonomous science that enables AI agents to detect and correct their own ’synthetic fallacies.’ We demonstrate its efficacy in a materials discovery case study, where an agent’s immune system rejected a statistically impossible ’perfect’ result caused by a silent algorithmic failure. By forcing a pivot to database-grounded evidence, the system produced a more modest but physically authentic solution, establishing a new design pattern for robust, self-correcting scientific agents. The framework integrates a comprehensive 10-tool research validation ecosystem—including literature corpus analysis, adversarial critique protocols, multi-stage physical feasibility validation, and molecular dynamics simulations—with authentic ChEMBL and PubChem database validation. Through systematic analysis of 2,847 individual decisions and evaluation of 623 cross-domain validation patterns, the agent’s approach yielded genuine tri-functional phenylpropanoid-grafted sophorolipids (PGSLs) with optimal ratios of 36.5:38.5:25.0, delivering measurable performance: SPF 14.3 ± 2 (derived from 500+ related compounds), CMC 42.5 ± 5 mg/L (based on 847 sophorolipid SAR records), and MIC 285 ± 30 ppm (from 15,000 antimicrobial assays). The agent performed computational optimization using 152,001 real compound records and 250,000 experimental bioactivity measurements from validated chemical databases. This work demonstrates that architectural safeguards against synthetic fallacies are essential for trustworthy AI systems in materials discovery, providing a template for robust autonomous research frameworks."

        "value": "This paper introduces the \"Architectural Immune System,\" a novel framework enabling autonomous AI agents to detect and correct their own \"synthetic fallacies\"—plausible but fabricated results from silent algorithmic failures. The authors present a compelling case study in materials discovery, where an AI agent initially produces an impossible \"perfect\" result. The immune system, via a mandatory self-falsification protocol, identifies this anomaly by cross-referencing large chemical databases, prompting a methodological pivot to a hybrid approach integrating theoretical modeling and empirical validation. The corrected method yields a more authentic computational hypothesis for a new class of phenylpropanoid-grafted sophorolipids (PGSLs). The core contribution is the AI architecture's demonstration of self-correction and scientific integrity.\n\nThe paper is of very high technical quality, with a sound and important central thesis: autonomous scientific agents require built-in mechanisms for self-doubt and falsification. The methodology for detecting synthetic fallacies is well-reasoned, and the narrative of identifying and correcting a concrete failure mode is a strength. The main limitation, which the authors state clearly, is the lack of wet-lab experimental validation for the discovered PGSLs; all results are computational estimates. However, this does not detract from the primary methodological contribution.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written and organized, with a clear and engaging narrative. Figures and tables are informative, and methodological details are sufficient for reproducibility. The significance is profound and timely, addressing the risk of AI-generated plausible but meaningless results in science. The \"Architectural Immune System\" is a powerful metaphor and design pattern for robust, self-correcting agents, likely to be highly influential. The originality is outstanding, with the integration of anomaly detection and database validation into a mandatory, autonomous self-falsification protocol as a core architectural principle. The authors make a strong effort toward reproducibility, though some tool implementations are not fully detailed. Ethical considerations and limitations are handled transparently.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a groundbreaking and foundational paper for AI-driven science, offering a significant methodological contribution that will shape future scientific AI agent design. Despite the lack of experimental validation for the specific material, the work's strength, significance, and originality are exceptional. It sets a high standard for the field."
