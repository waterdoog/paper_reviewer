        "value": "The paper introduces an innovative approach to ECG personalization by combining a frozen foundation model with a hyper-network–conditioned evidential head, and employs a two-stage meta-curriculum for robustness. The conceptual integration of evidential deep learning and hyper-networks is timely and potentially impactful for personalized healthcare, and the curriculum design is well-motivated. Reported improvements in calibration and efficiency are promising, and figures provide some qualitative support.\n\nHowever, the submission is critically under-specified in several key areas: the core method lacks precise mathematical and architectural details, the distinction between zero-shot and few-shot adaptation is unclear, and the evaluation omits strong baselines and comprehensive metrics. Statistical rigor is lacking, with no error bars or confidence intervals, and efficiency claims are unsubstantiated. Reproducibility is weak due to missing data protocols, hyperparameters, and code. Clinical validity and ethical considerations are not sufficiently addressed, and the comparison to related work is incomplete.\n\nActionable recommendations include providing full mathematical and architectural specifications, expanding baselines and metrics, clarifying adaptation settings, substantiating efficiency claims, and releasing code. In its current form, the paper's technical soundness and claims cannot be verified. I recommend rejection, encouraging a substantially revised version with complete specification and rigorous experiments."

        "value": "This research addresses a fundamental gap in uncertainty calibration during ECG model personalisation. We propose \\emph{Adaptive Evidential Meta-Learning}, a framework that attaches a lightweight evidential head with hyper-network-conditioned priors to a frozen ECG foundation model. The hyper-network dynamically sets the evidential prior using robust, class-conditional statistics computed from a few patient-specific ECG samples. Trained via a two-stage meta-curriculum, our approach enables rapid adaptation with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, making it highly applicable for real-world clinical deployment where both prediction accuracy and uncertainty awareness are crucial."

While the idea is original and timely, the paper falls short in several critical areas: the methodology lacks technical depth and formalism, the experimental evaluation is deeply flawed (with unconvincing results, misleading plots, and lack of statistical rigor), and the presentation is poor (illegible figures, missing context). The paper is not reproducible due to underspecified methods and unclear experimental setup. The entire research process was AI-generated, which may explain the lack of depth and rigor. To be publishable, the paper requires a complete overhaul of the method and results sections, improved experimental rigor, clearer figures, and a more nuanced analysis. In its current form, the paper is not acceptable for publication."

        "value": "This paper addresses the important problem of uncertainty calibration in ECG model personalization using a combination of evidential learning and hyper-networks for adaptive prior conditioning. While the approach is technically reasonable, the paper suffers from several significant shortcomings. The method description lacks sufficient technical depth and key algorithmic details, making it difficult to assess rigor. The experimental setup is superficial, with limited baseline comparisons and evaluation metrics, and the two-stage meta-curriculum approach is not thoroughly explained. Clarity issues are present, particularly in the method section and in the explanation of how different components interact. The contribution feels incremental, with limited novelty and generalizability, and only modest improvements in calibration metrics are demonstrated. Reproducibility is hampered by missing details and the absence of code at review time. Critically, the work is disclosed as almost entirely AI-generated, raising concerns about the depth of human expertise and validation. Overall, while the paper tackles a relevant problem, the execution and depth fall short of expectations for a top-tier venue."
