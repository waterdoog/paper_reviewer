        "value": "​Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibits a five-year survival rate persistently below 10%, as evidenced by recent epidemiological data [1]. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in multiple malignancies, their failure in PDAC is attributed to the profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This study elucidates the gut microbiota-tryptophan-kynurenine (Trp-Kyn) metabolic axis as a pivotal regulator of PDAC immune evasion. We demonstrate that microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g., indole-3-propionic acid [IPA] and deoxycholic acid [DCA]) modulate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling, leading to a 3.2-fold increase in regulatory T cell (Treg) frequency and 42% reduction in effector T cell (Teff) metabolic activity. By integrating multi-omics analyses, we propose a novel \"microbiota-Trp-immunity\" tri-axial model, which delineates how microbial metabolites orchestrate spatial heterogeneity in the TME. This framework underpins stratified interventions, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) combined with IDO1 inhibitors, to overcome therapeutic resistance.​"

        "value": "The paper addresses an important and timely topic at the intersection of tumor immunology, metabolism, and the microbiome, proposing a 'microbiota–tryptophan–kynurenine (Trp–Kyn)–immunity' tri-axial model for immune evasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It synthesizes known axes and discusses potential interventions, with clear articulation of spatial constraints and useful schematic figures. However, the manuscript suffers from major flaws: it presents precise quantitative findings and mechanistic claims without providing experimental methods, datasets, or verifiable sources, leading to questions about evidentiary support. There are multiple citation mismatches and unreliable sourcing, with some references not aligning with the claims made. The genre of the manuscript is ambiguous, oscillating between review and original research without clarity or appropriate supporting materials. The work is not reproducible due to lack of protocols, data, or code, and the conceptual integration is not fundamentally novel. Ethical considerations are acknowledged but not sufficiently addressed. The reviewer recommends a major rewrite, either as a rigorously sourced perspective or a fully substantiated original research article, and ultimately gives a strong reject recommendation due to the severity of the issues."

        "value": "This paper proposes a 'microbiota-tryptophan-immunity' tri-axial model to explain how gut microbiota reshape the immunosuppressive landscape in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through tryptophan-kynurenine metabolic pathways. While the topic is interesting and relevant to cancer immunotherapy, the paper has significant limitations that prevent it from meeting publication standards. The main issues include a lack of original experimental data, as the mechanistic claims and specific quantitative results are compiled from literature rather than new findings. The paper is largely generated by AI, raising concerns about authenticity and reliability. Although the writing is generally clear and the structure logical, inconsistent terminology and unconventional phrasing are present. The contribution is primarily a literature review with speculative therapeutic proposals, lacking experimental validation or reproducible findings. Major concerns include the absence of original data, questionable scientific rigor due to AI generation, unvalidated quantitative claims, and insufficient verification of references. The heavy reliance on AI for scientific content without adequate human oversight raises ethical concerns. Overall, the paper does not meet the standards for a scientific research publication."

        "value": "This paper presents a review and conceptual framework for the gut microbiota-tryptophan-kynurenine axis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a significant and timely topic. The manuscript is well-structured and synthesizes a large body of literature. However, it suffers from profound flaws that render it unsuitable for publication. The most critical issue is the misrepresentation of the work as original research, including the presentation of specific quantitative results as if they are novel findings, when in fact the paper is a literature review. The originality of the proposed model is questionable, as it repackages established concepts without new data. Most seriously, the paper relies on fabricated evidence, with citations that do not support the claims made and an admission that almost all content was generated by AI without proper verification. This systemic fabrication and lack of scholarly responsibility make the paper technically unsound and ethically unacceptable. The manuscript is misleading and risks propagating misinformation. In conclusion, the paper is an example of the dangers of uncritical AI use in scientific writing, failing in rigor, integrity, and truth. It is a strong and unequivocal reject."

The authors explicitly state they did not read each cited paper in detail (page 10–11), raising a high risk of miscitation.\n- Methodological opacity and contradictions: The main text reads as if original experiments were performed (organoids, mouse models, multi-omics), but the checklist claims NA for experiments and that the paper is review-like. No protocols, cohorts, or analysis pipelines are provided.\n- Dimensional inconsistencies and unclear units: Example—\"Kyn/Trp ratio > 50 um/mM\" (page 5) uses incoherent units for a ratio typically reported as dimensionless or µmol/mmol.\n- Overstated conclusions without evidentiary support: Claims such as spatially distinct AhR conformations (page 5, lines 191–193) and strong clinical translation proposals lack direct data and validation.\n- AI-generated content with limited human verification: The AI involvement section (pages 10–11) indicates AI generated most of the research narrative and references, and that humans did not fully verify the literature, undermining trust in technical claims and citations."
