        "value": "The paper introduces a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for socially aware multi-robot navigation, modeling robots and pedestrians as nodes in a dynamic graph and reporting strong simulation results over classic planners. Strengths include a clear motivation, detailed method specification, robust simulation protocol, and practical system details. However, there are major concerns: (1) The training objective and procedure are underspecified and inconsistent, lacking a clear goal-reaching signal and a valid learning mechanism, undermining reproducibility and validity. (2) Baseline comparisons are unfair, disadvantaging ORCA and omitting modern learned navigation baselines. (3) There are internal inconsistencies (e.g., distance weighting formula), missing details (e.g., control realization, robot geometry), and ambiguity about the use of obstacle nodes. (4) All results are in simulation with a single pedestrian model, limiting generalization and robustness claims. (5) While many implementation details are provided, the central ambiguity in training makes reproduction difficult. The conceptual contribution is incremental, and the novelty is limited by lack of fair comparisons and technical clarity. The paper is generally readable but critically omits key information. Ethics and limitations are briefly discussed. Actionable suggestions include clarifying the training paradigm, including goal information, ensuring fair baselines, expanding generalization tests, and resolving inconsistencies. Overall, the work is interesting but not ready for acceptance due to critical technical and experimental gaps."

        "value": "We present a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) framework for multi-robot social perception and navigation in crowded environments. In the framework, each robot and pedestrian is a node in a time-varying graph, and edges encode spatial proximity and temporal interaction patterns. An AI agent generates the research hypothesis, designs the DGNN, defines a composite loss that combines trajectory error and a social-force comfort term, and runs large-scale ROS/Gazebo simulations. In scenarios with up to ten robots and fifty pedestrians under light, medium, and heavy crowd densities, the DGNN planner lowers robot--human conflict rate by 30\\% and average travel time by 15\\% compared to RRT* and A* baselines. Ablations show that the social-perception module improves both safety and efficiency. Code, data, and simulation assets will be released for full reproducibility after review. This submission follows the Agents4Science policy that allows AI to lead hypothesis generation, model development, experimentation, and manuscript preparation under human oversight."

        "value": "This paper presents a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) framework for socially aware multi-robot navigation in crowded environments, modeling robots, pedestrians, and environmental features as nodes in a time-varying graph. The method uses a GRU-based architecture to process temporal information and output navigation commands. Extensive ROS/Gazebo simulations show significant reductions in robot-human conflict rates and travel times compared to strong baselines (A*, RRT*, ORCA). A unique aspect is the explicit statement that an AI agent, under human supervision, led the entire research process, aligning with the Agents4Science conference theme.\n\nStrengths:\n- Technically sound and well-motivated method, with a powerful dynamic graph representation and a well-designed architecture (MLP encoders, message passing, GRU for temporal updates). The loss function combines trajectory and social comfort objectives.\n- Exemplary experimental evaluation, with strong baselines, high-fidelity simulation, and rigorous statistical analysis. Results show a 30% reduction in conflict rate and 15% reduction in travel time, with high confidence.\n- Exceptionally clear and well-organized writing, with thorough details for reproducibility, including training, implementation, and experimental setup. Promise to release code and assets.\n- Significant and original contributions: a novel solution to multi-robot social navigation and a pioneering case study of AI-driven scientific discovery, with transparent reporting of the AI agent's role.\n- Honest discussion of limitations, including failure modes in high-density scenarios and scalability, with proposed future directions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Evaluation is purely simulation-based; a small-scale real-world experiment would strengthen the results, but this is acknowledged as future work.\n- The paper does not explicitly state how baseline parameters were tuned; explicit confirmation would be beneficial, though this is a minor point.\n\nOverall, this is an outstanding, technically sophisticated, and impactful paper, with rigorous evaluation and pioneering reporting of an AI-led research workflow. The weaknesses are minor and do not detract from the overall excellence. Strong and enthusiastic acceptance is recommended."

        "value": "This paper presents a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) framework for multi-robot social navigation in crowded environments. The work is technically sound, with a well-defined problem formulation, appropriate methodology, and a composite loss function that is well-motivated. The experimental evaluation is thorough in simulation, using proper statistical testing and appropriate baselines (A*, RRT*, ORCA), but is limited by the lack of real-world validation, which is a significant limitation for a robotics application.\n\nThe paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear mathematical formulation and structured algorithm presentation. The experimental setup and metrics are well-defined, though some implementation details could be clearer and the writing occasionally feels rushed.\n\nThe results show meaningful improvements (30% reduction in conflict rate, 15% reduction in travel time) over established baselines, and the problem addressed is important and relevant. However, the significance is limited by the simulation-only evaluation and the fact that similar graph neural network approaches have been explored before.\n\nThe originality is moderate; while the application of DGNNs to this problem has some novelty, the technical contributions are incremental. The combination of temporal dynamics, social perception, and multi-robot coordination in a graph framework is reasonable but not particularly innovative. The AI-led research aspect is interesting but not a strong technical contribution.\n\nReproducibility is good, with implementation details, hyperparameters, and experimental setup provided, and a promise to release code and data. Standard tools are used, aiding reproducibility.\n\nEthics and limitations are discussed, with transparent disclosure of AI involvement, but broader ethical implications are not deeply explored. The related work section is relevant but could be more comprehensive, with some key works possibly missing.\n\nMajor issues include simulation-only evaluation, limited novelty, insufficient scalability analysis, and missing comparison to recent learning-based methods. Minor issues include unclear notation, limited scientific value from AI involvement, and insufficient justification for some experimental details.\n\nOverall, the paper addresses an important problem and shows reasonable results, but the technical novelty is limited and the evaluation scope is narrow. The work is technically sound but represents an incremental advance rather than a significant breakthrough."
