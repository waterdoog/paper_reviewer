        "value": "This paper proposes the \"Dao of Discernment Framework\" (DDF) to address hallucinations in large language models by incorporating philosophical principles from Buddhism and Taoism into AI design. While the interdisciplinary approach is interesting, the paper suffers from several fundamental issues.\n\nQuality: The work lacks technical rigor. The paper primarily presents a conceptual framework without substantial experimental validation. The \"metacognitive discernment module\" is only prototyped, not fully implemented or evaluated. The mapping between philosophical concepts and technical implementations (Tables 1-2) is superficial and lacks depth. The paper cites a 2025 Kalai et al. work that appears questionable given the submission timeline. Most concerning is that this appears to be substantially AI-generated work, as acknowledged in the checklist where the authors admit \"AI completed most of writing work\" and conducted the experimental design primarily.\n\nClarity: The writing is verbose and lacks precision. The philosophical terminology is not rigorously defined in computational terms. The experimental design section promises evaluations that are never conducted. The paper conflates different types of uncertainty and oversimplifies the hallucination problem.\n\nSignificance: The contribution is primarily conceptual without demonstrable impact. The proposed metrics (HPS, ECE, KIS) are not novel - calibration error is well-established, and the others are vague reformulations of existing concepts. No empirical evidence supports the claimed benefits of the framework.\n\nOriginality: While the specific combination of Eastern philosophy with AI safety is somewhat novel, the individual technical components (uncertainty quantification, selective abstention, RLHF) are well-known. The philosophical interpretations are superficial and don't advance understanding in either domain.\n\nReproducibility: The paper lacks concrete implementation details. The experimental design is described but not executed. The \"prototype\" system is never actually evaluated, making reproduction impossible.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors do acknowledge limitations, though they understate the fundamental issue that this is primarily a position paper masquerading as an empirical contribution. The heavy reliance on AI generation raises questions about intellectual contribution.\n\nCitations: The reference to future work (Kalai et al. 2025) is problematic. Some philosophical sources are appropriate, but the technical literature review misses important recent work on uncertainty quantification and hallucination mitigation.\n\nThe paper reads more like an extended brainstorming session than rigorous research. The integration of Eastern philosophy with AI is potentially valuable, but requires much deeper technical grounding and empirical validation. The work would benefit from focusing on one concrete aspect (e.g., implementing and evaluating the abstention mechanism) rather than proposing a grand unified framework without validation.\n\nThe acknowledgment that this is primarily AI-generated work is concerning for a venue that should showcase human-AI collaboration in advancing science, not AI writing papers about AI with minimal human intellectual contribution."

        "value": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce “hallucinations”—outputs that are fluent but factually incorrect. Prior work demonstrates that such errors are not incidental but structurally inherent to next-token prediction (Kalai, Nachum, Vempala, \\& Zhang, 2025). We argue that hallucination is fundamentally an epistemic challenge and that addressing it requires more than optimization: it demands an interdisciplinary framework that integrates epistemic humility, calibrated discernment, and systemic responsibility into model design.\n\nWe introduce a novel interdisciplinary framework inspired by ancient inquiries into the nature of delusion. Drawing on classical analyses of illusion (Breaking Delusion) and restraint (Wu Wei) from Buddhist and Taoist traditions (Williams, 2009; Slingerland, 2003; Laozi, 2003), we translate these insights into technical interventions: abstention when uncertain, alignment of confidence with accuracy, and downstream karmic impact auditing (Harvey, 2012; Floridi \\& Cowls, 2021).\n\nWe prototype a novel Dao of Discernment Framework (DDF) including “metacognitive discernment” unit that operationalizes these principles through reinforcement learning from human feedback (Kadavath et al., 2022). Proposed experiments test whether such models achieve lower hallucination rates without loss of utility. By bridging machine learning with philosophical traditions that have long interrogated the nature of error and delusion, this work moves beyond algorithmic patches to offer a philosophy-driven blueprint for building AI systems that are not only more accurate but also more wise, trustworthy, and aligned with human values—ultimately guiding it toward transcending the very nature of delusion."

        "value": "This paper introduces the \"Dao of Discernment Framework\" (DDF), an interdisciplinary approach to mitigating hallucinations in LLMs by operationalizing virtues from Buddhist and Taoist philosophies into machine learning interventions. The review praises the paper's ambition, originality, and clarity, highlighting its strong conceptual development and the systematic mapping of philosophical concepts to technical implementations. The experimental plan is rigorous, and the proposed evaluation metrics are thoughtful. However, the main weakness is that the paper is a proposal without empirical results, and some technical components (e.g., Metacognitive Unit, Karmic Impact Score) are underspecified. The paper's clarity and significance are rated as exceptional and potentially groundbreaking, respectively, and its originality is highly commended. Reproducibility is low due to the lack of concrete technical details, but the ethical discussion is excellent. Constructive feedback includes requests for more technical detail, a pilot study or toy example, and clearer framing as a proposal. Despite its limitations, the paper is recommended for acceptance due to its conceptual depth, originality, and potential impact."

        "value": "This paper introduces the Dao of Discernment Framework (DDF), which reframes LLM hallucinations as epistemic failures and maps Buddhist and Taoist virtues to technical interventions. It proposes the Wisdom-Inspired Evaluation (WIE) suite with new metrics (HPS, ECE, KIS) and outlines a Self-Reflective Inference Pipeline. The conceptual reframing is coherent and the evaluation suite aims to move beyond accuracy, but the work lacks empirical results, concrete algorithmic details, and formal definitions for key metrics. Technical novelty is limited, as most mechanisms are known, and the main contribution is philosophical. The paper is well organized but reads more as a position paper than a technical study. Without empirical validation or rigorous formalization, its practical impact is limited. The paper is not reproducible as written, and key constructs are under-specified. Ethical considerations are thoughtfully discussed, but cross-cultural and annotation concerns need concrete protocols. The paper would benefit from formalizing metrics, providing algorithmic and empirical details, and comparing against strong baselines. As a position paper, it is intriguing, but for a high-standard venue, the lack of empirical results and formal definitions make it premature. The authors are encouraged to develop a full technical paper with implementation and rigorous evaluation."
