        "value": "This paper explores the mechanisms of moral elevation on prosocial intentions, with empathy as a mediator and group cohesion as a moderator, and is notable for being almost entirely AI-generated. The manuscript is well-written, with a thorough literature review, clear research gap, logical structure, and commendable transparency about the AI's role. However, it suffers from fatal scientific flaws: (1) the measure of group cohesion is conceptually invalid in the study context, rendering related findings uninterpretable; (2) the reported effect sizes are implausibly large, raising concerns about demand characteristics, analytical error, or data fabrication; (3) the lack of data and code makes the results irreproducible and unverifiable; (4) minor clarity issues exist, such as inconsistent hypothesis numbering. While the paper is significant as an AI-generated artifact and a cautionary tale about current AI limitations in science, it fails as scientific research due to fundamental methodological flaws, unbelievable results, and lack of transparency. Strong rejection is recommended, with encouragement for future work to include human oversight and rigorous validation."

        "value": "This paper investigates the relationship between moral elevation, empathy, group cohesion, and prosocial intentions using a methodologically sound online experimental design with validated measures and appropriate statistical analyses. The sample size is adequate, but there are several major concerns: (1) The manipulation check reports implausibly large effect sizes (d > 2.0), raising questions about validity and potential demand characteristics; (2) There is a complete absence of behavioral effects despite strong self-report effects, which is not sufficiently explored; (3) Some results are incomplete (e.g., a bootstrapped analysis is cut off in the text); (4) The extensive use of AI in all stages of the research, including literature review, hypothesis development, study design, data analysis, and writing, raises serious concerns about scientific integrity, authorship, and the peer review process. While the paper is generally well-written and organized, the theoretical contribution is modest, largely confirming existing findings with limited novel insights. Methods are described in detail, but the specific manipulation materials and raw data are not provided. Minor issues include typographical errors, incomplete sentences, citation formatting, and figures that may be more decorative than informative. Overall, the paper's scientific validity and contribution are undermined by methodological and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the unprecedented level of AI involvement."

        "value": "Moral elevation, the uplifting emotion elicited by witnessing virtuous acts, has been proposed as a key motivator of altruism. This study examined whether elevation promotes prosociality through affective and social mechanisms. A sample of 300 participants was recruited via Prolific and randomly assigned to view either an elevating or a neutral video. Following the induction, participants completed measures of moral elevation, empathy, group cohesion, and prosocial intentions, along with an optional donation task. Results confirmed that the elevation induction increased reported feelings of elevation, empathy, cohesion, and prosocial intentions. Mediation analysis showed that empathy partially explained the relationship between elevation and prosociality, while moderation analysis revealed that group cohesion strengthened the effect of empathy on prosocial intentions. Moderated mediation further indicated that the indirect effect of elevation was conditional on group cohesion. However, elevation did not significantly influence donation behavior, highlighting a gap between intentions and observable altruism."

        "value": "The paper investigates the effect of moral elevation on prosocial intentions via empathy, with group cohesion as a moderator, using an online video induction with 300 participants. While the topic is timely and the study uses validated instruments and attempts to integrate mediation and moderation, there are major concerns. These include measurement validity (use of trait empathy as a state measure, ambiguous group target for cohesion, inappropriate use of PHQ-9), implausibly large effect sizes, incomplete and inconsistent statistical reporting, questionable analysis provenance (claiming use of ChatGPT for PROCESS macro), lack of reproducibility (no data/code/materials), and absence of ethical approval or consent procedures. The design also suffers from low-stakes behavioral measures and lack of manipulation checks. Minor concerns include insufficient statistical detail in figures and possible redundancy in scales. The assessment finds substantial flaws in quality, clarity, significance, originality, reproducibility, and ethics. Actionable recommendations include pre-registration, use of appropriate measures, clear reporting, higher-stakes behavioral tasks, and proper ethical oversight. The bottom line is that, despite an interesting aim, the manuscript's serious methodological, reporting, and ethical omissions necessitate rejection in its current form."
