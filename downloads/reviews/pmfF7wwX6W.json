        "value": "The paper addresses an important question regarding the limits of the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and interpretability, taking an ambitious, multi-angle theoretical approach. It combines VC-dimension arguments, circuit complexity, algebraic constructions, information-theoretic bounds, and measure-theoretic results, and offers practical guidance for interpretability. However, there are major concerns: (1) Many technical claims are incorrect, unsubstantiated, or lack precise assumptions and rigorous proofs, especially regarding measure-theoretic results, circuit complexity, algebraic constructions, and information-theoretic bounds. (2) The paper claims experimental validation but provides no actual empirical results, only protocols and expected outcomes. (3) Key definitions and assumptions are imprecise or missing, undermining the validity of theorems. (4) Much of the content restates known results or overreaches without rigor, and the central conclusion is already established in the literature. While the writing is generally clear, many proofs are missing or sketch-level, and references do not support specific claims. There are no ethical concerns, and the paper discusses limitations of LRH. Actionable recommendations include tightening theoretical results with precise assumptions and complete proofs, aligning claims with classical results, clarifying circuit complexity sections, and either providing real experimental results or removing empirical claims. Overall, the paper requires substantial revision to meet the standards of a top venue."

The strengths of the paper include its exceptional theoretical depth, high significance for the interpretability field, originality in synthesizing classical and novel arguments, clarity of exposition, and a balanced discussion of when LRH might hold approximately. However, the paper's main weakness is a significant overclaim regarding empirical validation: while the abstract and a dedicated section promise experimental results, none are actually provided—only protocols are outlined. This discrepancy undermines the credibility of the stated contributions. The reviewer recommends acceptance only if the authors either conduct and report the experiments or revise the paper to accurately reflect its purely theoretical nature. Overall, the work is outstanding in theory but incomplete as currently presented, leading to a borderline accept rating contingent on addressing the empirical validation issue."

We complement theory with reproducible experiments and discuss precise conditions under which LRH holds approximately."

        "value": "This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis challenging the universality of the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) in deep neural networks through multiple mathematical lenses. \n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe paper demonstrates strong theoretical rigor across multiple complementary approaches: VC-dimension theory, circuit complexity, algebraic constructions, information theory, and measure theory. The mathematical results appear technically sound, with theorems properly stated and proofs outlined (though full proofs are relegated to appendix). The combination of different theoretical perspectives strengthens the overall argument. However, some proofs could benefit from more detailed exposition in the main text.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly written. The progression from combinatorial arguments to circuit complexity to explicit constructions creates a coherent narrative. Definitions are precise, and the mathematical framework is established early. The extensive use of theorems and formal statements enhances clarity for the target audience.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThis work addresses a fundamental assumption underlying many interpretability methods. The theoretical results have significant implications for how we understand and develop interpretability techniques. The paper provides actionable insights about when linear probes fail and suggests alternative approaches. This could redirect research in neural network interpretability toward more principled methods.\n\nOriginality:\nThe systematic theoretical attack on LRH from multiple angles appears novel. While individual components (VC theory, circuit complexity) are well-known, their coordinated application to analyze linear representability is original. The specific constructions and bounds appear new to the literature.\n\nReproducibility:\nAs primarily a theoretical work, reproducibility concerns are limited. The mathematical results can be verified through the proofs. The paper includes experimental protocols in the appendix, though the main contribution is theoretical. The checklist indicates the work is primarily theoretical with experimental validation being secondary.\n\nLimitations and Ethics:\nThe authors adequately discuss limitations and provide concrete recommendations for alternative interpretability approaches. They acknowledge the continued utility of linear probes while emphasizing their limitations. The work has positive implications for AI safety by providing more rigorous foundations for interpretability.\n\nTechnical Issues:\n1. Some notation could be clearer (e.g., the relationship between different complexity measures)\n2. The transition between theoretical results and practical implications could be smoother\n3. Some proofs in the appendix appear incomplete or could benefit from more detail\n\nAI Involvement Consideration:\nThe checklist indicates significant AI involvement in theoretical exploration, analysis, and writing (marked as [D] and [C]). Given that this is the Agents4Science conference which allows such involvement, this is acceptable and the theoretical contributions appear sound regardless of their origin.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some figures or visualizations could enhance understanding of the geometric arguments\n- The experimental validation, while described, could be more prominent if empirical evidence is available\n- Some theorem statements could be more intuitive before diving into technical details\n\nOverall Assessment:\nThis is a solid theoretical contribution that challenges an important assumption in interpretability research. The multi-faceted theoretical approach is convincing and the implications are significant for the field. While primarily theoretical, it provides practical guidance for interpretability research. The work would benefit the community by providing more rigorous foundations for understanding when and why linear probes succeed or fail.\n\nThe paper makes important theoretical contributions with clear practical implications, is well-written and technically sound, and addresses a fundamental question in neural network interpretability."

Appendix B reports only protocols and 'Expected Results' without data.\n- Ambiguities and dimensional inconsistencies in several bounds (e.g., Theorem 14, p. 7) and imprecise definitions (e.g., Definition 9 with 'concept information content' and SNR).\n- Overreliance on proof sketches and missing detailed, correct proofs for many central theorems beyond Theorem 1."
