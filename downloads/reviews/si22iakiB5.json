      "abstract": {
        "value": "Endoscopic video super-resolution (EVSR) seeks to reconstruct high-resolution frames from low-resolution endoscopic video, a task critical for enhancing clinical visualization of fine anatomical details. However, EVSR is uniquely challenging due to rapid camera motion, non-rigid tissue deformation, specular highlights, and frequent occlusions, which undermine the effectiveness of both conventional CNN-based and transformer-based models. To address these issues, we propose a novel EVSR framework that leverages the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture for efficient long-range temporal modeling. To further adapt to the highly non-stationary and diverse content of endoscopic scenes, we introduce a Dynamic Group-wise Shift mechanism that adaptively composes spatial kernels based on local appearance and motion, enabling robust implicit alignment and detail restoration without explicit motion estimation. Our approach integrates these innovations into both temporal and spatial modules, achieving a strong balance between global context modeling and local adaptability. Extensive experiments on a synthetic endoscopic video dataset demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance, maintaining small yet stable advantages over recent CNN- and transformer-based baselines in quantitative comparisons."

        "value": "This paper presents EndoNet, a framework for endoscopic video super-resolution using the RWKV architecture and a Dynamic Group-wise Shift mechanism. The review systematically evaluates the work across several dimensions:\n\n- Quality (2/6): The paper has significant technical issues, including poorly explained and inconsistent mathematical formulations, lack of rigorous justification for the proposed mechanisms, and only marginal experimental improvements.\n- Clarity (2/6): The organization and presentation are poor, with unclear connections between concepts, inconsistent notation, missing implementation details, and low-quality figures.\n- Significance (2/6): The contributions are incremental, with minor modifications to existing techniques and marginal improvements that do not justify the added complexity.\n- Originality (3/6): The combination of RWKV with DGW-Shift is somewhat novel, but both are straightforward adaptations, and the overall novelty is insufficient for a top-tier venue.\n- Reproducibility (1/6): Crucial implementation details are missing, making reproduction difficult. The experimental setup is weak.\n- Ethics and Limitations (4/6): Some limitations and societal impacts are discussed, but the major issue of only evaluating on synthetic data is not adequately addressed.\n- Citations and Related Work (3/6): The related work section is superficial and lacks depth in comparison to recent advances.\n\nMajor issues include heavy AI involvement, incomplete mathematical formulations, insufficient experimental validation, missing implementation details, and poor presentation. Minor issues include inconsistent notation, low-quality figures, grammatical errors, and missing computational complexity analysis. Overall, the paper addresses an important application but lacks rigor, novelty, and depth, resulting in a technically shallow contribution."

        "value": "The paper introduces EndoNet, an endoscopic video super-resolution (EVSR) model that leverages RWKV-based linear attention for temporal modeling and a Dynamic Group-wise Shift (DGW-Shift) operator for adaptive spatial/temporal filtering. The architecture is novel for EVSR and is well-motivated by the unique challenges of endoscopic video. The paper provides ablation studies and discusses ethical considerations and limitations.\n\nHowever, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset (HyperKvasir) with synthetic bicubic downsampling, lacking validation on real clinical data or domain-shifted scenarios. The reported quantitative improvements are marginal (e.g., 0.16 dB PSNR gain over BasicVSR++ with lower SSIM), and there are concerns about potentially misconfigured baselines. The paper does not report temporal stability or perceptual metrics, nor does it substantiate claims of computational efficiency with runtime or scaling analyses. Critical implementation details are missing or inconsistent, and the reproducibility of the work is hindered by underspecified architecture and training parameters. The coverage of related work is somewhat limited, omitting comparisons to several strong recent VSR and medical EVSR baselines.\n\nActionable suggestions include expanding evaluation to real clinical data, reporting efficiency metrics, improving reproducibility with detailed specifications and code release, broadening baseline comparisons, and testing robustness under realistic degradations. While the architectural direction is interesting, the current empirical evidence and reporting are insufficient for acceptance. The reviewer recommends rejection in the current form, with a path to resubmission after substantial improvements."

The approach is well-motivated, especially for medical video, and the architecture is logical with ablation studies supporting component contributions. However, the claimed performance gains are marginal and inconsistent: EndoNet's PSNR improvement over BasicVSR++ is only 0.16 dB, and its SSIM is actually lower, undermining the claim of overall superiority. The evaluation is limited to synthetically degraded data, leaving robustness to real-world artifacts unproven. The paper is generally clear and well-organized, but omits critical architectural and hyperparameter details, making reproduction impossible. The work is original in its application of RWKV and DGW-Shift to EVSR, but the lack of reproducibility and weak empirical support are major flaws. The discussion of limitations and ethics is thoughtful. Overall, while the direction is promising and the ideas are strong, the paper falls short in empirical validation and reproducibility, leading to a borderline reject recommendation."
