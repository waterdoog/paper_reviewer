        "value": "This paper presents CellDreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using Dreamer for optimizing neural cell culture protocols. The technical approach is sound, adapting Dreamer to biological simulators with uncertainty-aware world models and constraint-aware rewards. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (Random, PPO, BO where available) across six simulator environments. However, there are significant concerns: only n=3 seeds, which is insufficient for robust statistical conclusions; all results are on simulators only with no real biological validation; the neurite-length endpoints are acknowledged as unvalidated proxies; missing per-seed tables prevent proper statistical analysis; and BO comparison is only available for one environment. The paper is generally well-written with clear problem motivation and method description, and figures effectively communicate results. Implementation details are sufficiently provided for reproduction, but the heavy reliance on descriptive statistics due to small sample sizes weakens the presentation. The application area is important and the problem well-motivated, but the impact is significantly limited by lack of real-world validation, small-scale evaluation, limited comparison with BO, and results confined to simulated environments with proxy metrics. The work represents a reasonable adaptation of existing methods to a new domain rather than fundamental algorithmic innovation. The authors provide comprehensive reproducibility information, which is a strength. The limitations section is thorough and the authors don't overclaim. The paper adequately cites relevant work. Major concerns include no real biological validation, small sample size, limited baseline comparisons, and use of proxy simulations. Minor issues include some unclear mathematical notation and limited transfer experiments. The paper tackles an important problem and shows technical competence, but the evaluation is insufficient to support strong conclusions about real-world applicability. The simulator-only results with small sample sizes significantly limit the impact and reliability of findings."

        "value": "This paper introduces CellDreamer, an adaptation of the Dreamer model-based RL agent, for optimizing neural cell culture protocols—a high-dimensional, noisy, sample-limited control problem with long horizons and safety constraints. CellDreamer features an uncertainty-aware world model, constraint-aware rewards, and transfer learning. Evaluated in six simulated environments, it outperforms Random search, PPO, and, where possible, Bayesian Optimization in final reward and learning efficiency. Extensive ablation studies and a transfer learning experiment validate the approach. The authors are transparent about limitations, notably the lack of wet-lab validation and the small number of seeds (n=3).\n\nStrengths include the significance and novelty of applying model-based RL to biotechnology, technical rigor, clear and organized presentation, exemplary discussion of limitations and ethics, and a strong commitment to reproducibility. Weaknesses are primarily the simulation-only results and limited statistical power due to few seeds, both of which the authors acknowledge and address constructively.\n\nOverall, this is a high-quality, well-presented paper that makes a significant contribution to AI for science. While not yet groundbreaking due to the lack of real-world validation, it lays a solid foundation for future work and is highly recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "The paper proposes CellDreamer, a Dreamer-style, uncertainty-aware world model–based RL approach for optimizing neural cell culture protocols in simulators. The method adapts Dreamer with stochastic recurrent state-space models, soft-constraint penalties, and robustness mechanisms. Empirical results across six simulated environments show CellDreamer outperforming Random and PPO, and exceeding Bayesian optimization (BO) on one environment. Ablations and a small transfer study support design choices. The paper is explicit about limitations (no wet-lab validation, small n, limited BO scope) and outlines a prospective validation plan.\n\nStrengths include clear problem framing, sensible Dreamer instantiation, consistent empirical advantages, honest limitations, thorough method detail, and a strong reproducibility statement. Weaknesses are limited novelty (most uncertainty-aware elements are standard in Dreamer), narrow evaluation (missing key model-based RL baselines, sparse BO comparisons, small n, limited statistical rigor), unclear numerical reporting due to typesetting artifacts, lack of real-world validation, limited transfer/generalization, unquantified calibration/safety, and some gaps in environment detail and compute parity.\n\nThe assessment finds the work methodologically sound but limited by narrow baselines and statistics, generally clear but with some clarity issues, potentially impactful but currently limited in significance, incremental in originality, promising in reproducibility (pending artifact release), strong in ethics/limitations, and generally appropriate in citations. Actionable suggestions include expanding baselines, increasing statistical rigor, quantifying safety/uncertainty, providing more environment detail, broadening transfer experiments, and pursuing real-world validation.\n\nOverall, this is a careful application of Dreamer to a biological simulator suite with reasonable ablations and responsible discussion of limitations. However, limited novelty, missing baselines, thin statistics, and lack of wet-lab validation mean it falls short for a high-bar venue at this stage. The authors are encouraged to strengthen baselines, statistics, and provide preliminary wet-lab validation to elevate the contribution."

        "value": "Optimizing biological systems---e.g., cell-culture protocols, neurite morphogenesis proxies, and metabolic setpoints---is a high-dimensional, noisy, sample-limited control problem. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) can improve data efficiency by learning compact dynamics models that enable planning before costly experiments. We adapt Dreamer to biologically grounded simulators with uncertainty-aware world models, constraint-aware rewards, and task-shared priors for transfer. Baselines include Random, model-free PPO, and Bayesian Optimization (BO). We ablate world-model capacity and components and evaluate zero-shot and few-shot transfer.\n\nAcross six simulator environments, CellDreamer (Dreamer/model01) reliably exceeds Random and model-free PPO on final reward and area under the learning curve (AUC) in all evaluated cases (n=3 seeds). Against BO, available artifacts allow a direct comparison on one environment (Env06), where Dreamer outperforms BO on both final reward and AUC. Ablations on a representative task show monotonic benefits with larger capacity and intact reward/continuation and decoder pathways. Adding AR(1) observation noise modestly reduces performance but preserves Dreamer's advantage over PPO and Random. Transfer experiments on a delayed, band-limited target task show consistent 1-shot improvements from pretraining. We do not report statistical significance due to small n and missing per-seed tables; neurite-length endpoints are proxy simulations and were not experimentally validated here.\n\nThese results indicate that uncertainty-aware, world model--based RL is a practical, sample-efficient optimizer for biological design spaces and that pretrained models can accelerate adaptation on related tasks."
