        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Dimensional inconsistencies and ad hoc de Sitter modifications: ℓ_Λ = (Λ G_N)^(-1/4) used as a length (Section S, Eq. 24), and Eq. (23) mixes a scalar divergence with a density via √h; both are dimensionally incorrect.\n- Nonstandard/incorrect equations linking entanglement and geometry (e.g., Eq. (2), (4), (6)) without accepted derivations.\n- Invalid Lie algebra detection: using Pauli products (rather than commutators with i structure constants) to test SU(2)/SU(3) subalgebras (Section P).\n- Physically incorrect operator evolution: using stabilizers as Hamiltonian and updating operators ‘mod 2’ to model Heisenberg dynamics (Section Q.2), making the Lieb–Robinson verification procedure unsound.\n- Claims of benchmarking and performance (e.g., 85% evaluation reduction) without actual experiments; Appendices provide pseudocode plans, not results.\n- Speculative/unsupported derivations: selecting d=3 from error-correction and holographic arguments; quantized dark-energy ratio Ω_Λ/Ω_m ≈ 2^{n-2k} (Eq. 39).\n- Heuristic and unvalidated geometry reconstruction: MI→MDS embedding→min-cut as ‘minimal surface’ for RT checks.\n- Inconsistent unit conventions (mixing SI and natural units; inclusion/omission of c and ℏ) and duplicated/misattributed formulas (two RT equations; mention of central charge c without consistent usage).\n- Over-reliance on weak or non-peer-reviewed sources for critical claims."

        "value": "This paper proposes an AI-driven approach to search for a hypothetical \"cosmic code\"—a quantum error-correcting code (QECC) that could underlie spacetime and unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. While the topic is ambitious and addresses a fundamental problem in physics, the paper exhibits significant issues across all evaluation criteria.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness: The paper makes an extraordinary claim—that spacetime is encoded as a specific QECC—without providing sufficient theoretical foundation. The connection between the holographic principle, AdS/CFT, and the proposed search framework relies heavily on speculative extensions. The adaptation from AdS space (Λ < 0) to de Sitter-like cosmologies (Λ > 0) is acknowledged as \"necessarily speculative\" without rigorous justification. The three proposed adaptations (modified RT formula, quantum corrections, and cosmological constant as code structure) lack mathematical rigor and experimental grounding. The symbolic regression approach to discover QECCs, while computationally feasible, faces fundamental issues. The search space is hyper-exponentially large (∼2^(2^n)), and there's no guarantee that even sophisticated AI can navigate this effectively. The physics-informed reward function, while clever, may not capture the true complexity of physical requirements.\n\nClarity and Organization: The paper is generally well-written but suffers from excessive length and dense mathematical notation that obscures the core arguments. The supplementary material is extensive (reaching 40+ pages) but contains largely algorithmic details rather than addressing fundamental theoretical gaps. Key concepts like the \"cosmic code\" remain poorly defined beyond the assertion that it exists.\n\nSignificance and Impact: While the unification of GR and QM is undeniably significant, this approach is highly speculative. The paper doesn't adequately address why existing approaches (string theory, LQG) have failed and how this computational search would succeed where theoretical physics has struggled. The claimed falsifiable predictions (CMB signatures ~10^-30, gravitational wave background) are far beyond current experimental sensitivity and may remain untestable indefinitely.\n\nOriginality: The combination of holographic principles, QECCs, and AI-driven search is novel. However, the individual components are well-established, and the synthesis lacks the theoretical depth needed to justify such an ambitious claim.\n\nReproducibility: The computational framework is well-described with extensive algorithmic details. However, the theoretical assumptions underlying the search are not sufficiently justified to enable meaningful reproduction of results.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. The fundamental assumption that spacetime is encoded as a specific QECC lacks theoretical justification\n2. The extension from AdS/CFT to realistic cosmologies is highly speculative\n3. The computational search may discover complex codes that satisfy the reward function without physical meaning (\"Pythagorean nightmare\" acknowledged but not adequately addressed)\n4. Key predictions are experimentally untestable with current or foreseeable technology\n5. The paper doesn't adequately explain why this approach should succeed where decades of theoretical physics have struggled\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Anonymous submission format prevents assessment of author credibility\n- Some mathematical notation could be simplified\n- The connection between discovered codes and actual physics remains unclear\n\nThe paper tackles an important problem with creative methodology, but the theoretical foundation is too speculative and the approach too uncertain to warrant publication at a top-tier venue. The work would benefit from stronger theoretical grounding and more realistic claims about what such a computational search might achieve."

        "value": "The unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics has resisted decades of human-led theoretical efforts. We hypothesize that this impasse can be broken by reframing the problem as a systematic, AI-guided search through the abstract space of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). Drawing a synthesis from the holographic principle, quantum information theory, and reinforcement learning, we argue that the laws of physics are emergent properties of an underlying informational code. We propose a concrete methodological framework—an automated discovery framework that uses symbolic regression to generate novel QECCs and deep reinforcement learning to validate them against known physical principles. This paper presents the full theoretical rationale and architectural design for this framework, establishing a new, falsifiable research program for $\\text{21}^{\\text{st}}$-century theoretical physics."

The approach combines symbolic regression for code generation with a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent for interrogation, guided by physics-informed rewards. The manuscript is well-organized, with detailed pseudo-code and system blueprints, and thoughtfully considers potential pitfalls such as reward hacking and computational intractability. If successful, the impact could be significant.\n\nHowever, the work is purely programmatic, lacking any empirical results, proof-of-concept demonstrations, or quantitative benchmarks. Key reward components are ill-defined or unrealistic, and several physics claims are overstated or imprecise. Computational feasibility is insufficiently grounded, and the bibliography includes questionable citations. The predictions are not presently actionable, and the work is not currently reproducible due to the absence of implementation or data. While the paper is upfront about its limitations and ethical considerations, the lack of concrete results and the speculative nature of core components prevent a recommendation for acceptance at this time. Constructive suggestions include narrowing the initial goal, providing empirical validation, strengthening theoretical grounding, improving scholarship, and making the work reproducible."

        "value": "This paper presents a bold and exceptionally well-articulated proposal for a new research program aimed at one of the most profound challenges in science: the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics. The authors propose to reframe this long-standing problem as a systematic, AI-guided search for a \"cosmic code\"—a specific quantum error-correcting code (QECC) whose emergent properties would correspond to the known laws of physics. This is a work of immense ambition, impressive intellectual synthesis, and remarkable technical detail.\n\n**Quality:** The submission is of the highest technical quality. While it is a proposal and does not contain experimental or computational results, the theoretical and architectural blueprint it provides is exceptionally sound and complete. The authors demonstrate a masterful command of three distinct and highly complex fields: fundamental physics (holography, quantum gravity), quantum information theory (QECCs), and artificial intelligence (symbolic regression, deep reinforcement learning). The synthesis of these fields is not merely conceptual; it is backed by a concrete, well-reasoned methodological framework. The proposed reward function, grounded in fundamental principles like the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, the Standard Model gauge group, and relativistic causality, is a particularly strong feature that bridges the AI's search space with physical reality. The authors are commendably transparent about the speculative nature of certain assumptions, particularly the extension of holographic principles to a de Sitter universe, and they address potential counterarguments with rigor and intellectual honesty in Section 4.3.\n\n**Clarity:** The paper is a model of clarity. It is exceptionally well-written and logically structured. The authors succeed in making incredibly dense subject matter accessible without sacrificing technical precision. The main text flows logically from the problem's motivation to the theoretical underpinnings and finally to the proposed AI architecture. The decision to relegate the extensive implementation details and mathematical formalism to a comprehensive set of appendices is wise, allowing the core argument to be presented with force and clarity.\n\n**Significance:** The potential impact of this work cannot be overstated. It addresses the \"holy grail\" of modern theoretical physics. A successful execution of this research program would represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of the universe and in the methodology of scientific discovery itself. Even partial success—such as the discovery of novel holographic codes with physically interesting properties—would constitute a major advance. The most significant aspect of the proposal is its commitment to falsifiability (Section 4.2), outlining how a discovered code would produce concrete, testable predictions for Planck-scale physics. This elevates the proposal from philosophical speculation to a genuine scientific endeavor.\n\n**Originality:** While the constituent ideas (holography as a QECC, \"It from Qubit\") have been developed within the physics community, the central contribution of this paper is profoundly original. It consists in translating this physical intuition into a concrete, well-defined, and automated computational search. The specific AI architecture—a generative engine based on symbolic regression coupled with a validation engine using reinforcement learning to learn an efficient interrogation policy—is a novel and powerful combination tailored specifically for this unique problem. This represents a groundbreaking fusion of theoretical physics and state-of-the-art AI.\n\n**Reproducibility:** For a proposal paper, the level of detail provided for methodological reproducibility is extraordinary. The extensive appendices, which include detailed mathematical frameworks, algorithmic pseudo-code for all major components (genetic programming, hierarchical search, computational optimizations), and resource estimates, provide a clear and actionable blueprint. A dedicated and well-resourced research team could, in principle, begin implementing this framework based on the information provided. This goes far beyond the standard for a theoretical proposal.\n\n**Ethics and Limitations:** The authors excel in their discussion of limitations and challenges. They proactively address the primary criticisms one might levy against the proposal, including computational infeasibility and the risk of discovering unphysical, overfitted solutions (\"Pythagorean nightmare\"). Their proposed mitigations—calibration, structural priors, simplicity constraints, and the ultimate arbiter of falsifiable prediction—are well-reasoned. There are no ethical concerns with this work.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a landmark proposal that is perfectly suited for the Agents4Science conference. It is a visionary paper that is simultaneously bold in its ambition and rigorous in its execution. It outlines a path forward on a problem where progress has stalled for decades, leveraging the unique capabilities of AI to navigate a search space that is beyond the scope of human intuition. The paper is not just a sketch of an idea; it is a detailed, comprehensive, and compelling blueprint for a new era of computational theoretical physics. It has my strongest possible recommendation for acceptance."
