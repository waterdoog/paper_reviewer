        "value": "This paper presents Entropy-Weighted Local Concept Matching (ELCM), an improvement to GL-MCM for zero-shot out-of-distribution detection in vision-language models. The technical approach is sound and theoretically motivated, using Shannon entropy to weight patch-level contributions, but the improvement is modest (AUROC from 0.9129 to 0.9188, FPR95 from 0.3495 to 0.2975) and introduces hyperparameter sensitivity. The implementation includes ad-hoc components that undermine the theoretical elegance. The paper is well-written and clearly structured, though some implementation details are relegated to the appendix. The impact is limited, as improvements are modest and only compared to GL-MCM, not other methods. The originality lies in applying entropy-based weighting, but the work is incremental. Reproducibility is reasonable, with code provided, but evaluation is limited to 100 images per dataset. The authors are transparent about limitations, including hyperparameter sensitivity and limited baseline comparisons. Related work is adequate but could be broader. Major concerns include limited evaluation scope, modest improvements, hyperparameter sensitivity, and ad-hoc enhancements. Strengths are theoretical motivation, honest evaluation, consistent improvements, and clear presentation. Overall, the paper is a solid incremental contribution but does not make a significant impact due to modest improvements and practical limitations."

        "value": "This paper introduces Entropy-Weighted Local Concept Matching (ELCM), a novel, theoretically-motivated method for zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using vision-language models. The main contribution is an entropy-based weighting scheme for aggregating patch-level predictions, addressing the limitations of max-pooling in prior work (GL-MCM). The paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and demonstrates consistent improvements over the GL-MCM baseline on several OOD datasets, with notable reductions in FPR95. The authors are transparent about the method's limitations.\n\nHowever, the experimental validation is insufficient: the evaluation is limited to a single baseline (GL-MCM), with no comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, making it difficult to assess the true significance of the approach. The experiments are conducted on small samples without statistical robustness (no error bars or multiple runs), and the method is highly sensitive to a key hyperparameter. Additionally, the impact of several engineering enhancements is not disentangled from the core contribution due to a lack of detailed ablation studies.\n\nOverall, while the idea is promising and the presentation is strong, the paper's empirical evidence is too weak to support acceptance. I recommend rejection in its current form, but encourage the authors to address the experimental shortcomings and resubmit, as the core idea could underpin a strong future paper."

        "value": "The paper proposes Entropy-Weighted Local Concept Matching (ELCM), a training-free, zero-shot modification to GL-MCM for OOD detection with CLIP. ELCM replaces local max-pooling with an information-theoretic aggregation using Shannon entropy to weight per-patch class probabilities, downweighting uncertain patches and emphasizing confident ones. Enhancements include top-k patch selection, percentile-based weight stabilization, and class-conditional scaling. On ImageNet-OOD subsets, ELCM shows modest overall gains (AUROC: 0.9129→0.9188; FPR95: 0.3495→0.2975), with larger FPR reductions on iNaturalist and SUN. \n\nStrengths:\n- The method is simple, clear, and training-free, with minimal overhead.\n- Uses a principled uncertainty signal to address max-pooling weaknesses.\n- Qualitative evidence is provided via score distributions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Evaluation is on very small subsets (100–500 images), lacking error bars and statistical testing, which limits reliability and invites sampling variance.\n- Baselines are limited to GL-MCM; no comparisons to other zero-shot OOD methods (e.g., CLIPN, ZOC, MCM).\n- The method is sensitive to the α parameter, with no automatic selection mechanism, raising deployment risk.\n- Inconsistency in claims: Table 1 claims “consistent improvements,” but SUN AUROC decreases while FPR95 improves.\n- Subset selection details (randomization, seeds) are unspecified, limiting interpretability and reproducibility.\n- The “first” claim of an information-theoretic framework is overstated, as related ideas exist.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Expand evaluation to full ImageNet-OOD benchmarks, use multiple random seeds, and report confidence intervals.\n2. Compare against more zero-shot OOD methods under a standardized protocol.\n3. Provide sensitivity analyses and investigate automatic α selection.\n4. Clarify subset selection and compute details; include runtime benchmarks.\n5. Add qualitative visualizations of entropy weights on images.\n6. Correct or qualify the “consistent improvements” claim and discuss the SUN AUROC trade-off.\n7. Consider alternative uncertainty signals and report ablations.\n8. If claiming theoretical grounding, provide supporting analysis.\n\nOverall, the idea is neat and potentially useful, but the current empirical evidence is too limited for acceptance at a high-standard venue. Strengthening evaluation and comparisons would improve the paper’s credibility and impact."

      "abstract": {
        "value": "Zero-shot out-of-distribution detection with vision-language models faces a fundamental challenge: how to reliably aggregate patch-level information without being misled by spurious activations from noisy or ambiguous image regions. Existing approaches like GL-MCM use simple max-pooling over local patch confidences, treating all patches equally and making systems vulnerable to false alarms from misleading alignments on background elements or partial out-of-distribution content. We introduce Entropy-Weighted Local Concept Matching (ELCM), a principled information-theoretic framework that addresses this critical limitation by automatically assessing patch reliability through uncertainty quantification. For each spatial patch, ELCM computes probability distributions over in-distribution classes, measures Shannon entropy to quantify prediction uncertainty, and applies exponential weighting that emphasizes confident patches while suppressing ambiguous ones. This entropy-driven aggregation replaces heuristic max-pooling with theoretically-grounded patch importance assignment, requiring no additional training while maintaining strict zero-shot constraints. Extensive evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in detection reliability: overall AUROC increases from 0.9129 to 0.9188 with 15 percent reduction in false positive rates (FPR95: 0.3495 to 0.2975). Notably, ELCM achieves 19 percent FPR95 reduction on iNaturalist and 23 percent reduction on SUN, with consistent improvements across diverse visual domains including natural scenes, architectural environments, and texture patterns. The method addresses a fundamental gap in vision-language OOD detection and establishes entropy-based aggregation as an effective paradigm for robust patch-level reasoning in complex visual environments."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Scale mismatch in aggregation: SELCM is an unnormalized sum over patches combined with a single global probability (SMCM) via SFinal = SMCM + λ·SELCM; this can distort scales and requires ad hoc mitigation (e.g., top-k). Normalizing by ∑i wi or by k would be more principled.\n- Entropy not normalized by log K, making α depend on the number of classes K; reduces generality/transferability of α and complicates interpretation across settings.\n- Implementation–specification mismatch: Figures (pages 6–7) say scores are negative, but Section 3 defines non-negative, probability-based scores. The exact implemented scoring (e.g., log-space/energy formulation) is not documented, undermining formal correctness and reproducibility.\n- Inconsistent claims: Table 1 (page 5) shows SUN AUROC decreases (0.931 → 0.915) while the caption claims “consistent improvements across all datasets.”\n- Under-specified enhancements: “Class-conditional scaling” is not precisely defined; with β=1.0 it has no effect, yet the text claims it improves robustness. Percentile-based stabilization is described qualitatively without a formula.\n- Limited experimental rigor: very small sample size (100 images per OOD dataset), no error bars or repeated runs; small AUROC gains may not be statistically significant.\n- Limited baseline coverage: only GL-MCM is compared; no comparisons to other zero-shot OOD methods (e.g., CLIPN, ZOC, MCM), limiting the generality of claims.\n- Ambiguity in data/protocol details: selection procedure for image subsets, prompt templates, resolution/patch grid, and exact implementation details are not fully specified in the main text.\n- Minor conceptual imprecision: description that weak entropy weighting “amplifies” uncertain patches is inaccurate; it rather insufficiently suppresses them."
