        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Percent improvement calculations are inconsistent with Table 1 (page 3); −285.00 to −286.17 is ~0.41%, not 8.41%. Electrostatic mutant is reported improved in text but is worse in the table (−281.00 vs −285.00).\n- Undefined and potentially misused “confidence” metric from HDOCK; treated as a percent without calibration or explanation.\n- Insufficient methodological detail: no explicit list of mutated residues, no protonation/ionic strength settings for APBS/PDB2PQR, no minimization force field/steps, and only “standard parameters” for HDOCK.\n- Likely misrepresentation of TRAIL structure/stoichiometry: Figure 1 caption on page 2 refers to a “TRAIL helix,” whereas TRAIL is predominantly β-sandwich and functions as a trimer; oligomeric state of docking not clarified.\n- No validation against known TRAIL–DR5 complex structures (e.g., redocking to reproduce crystallographic poses) and no orthogonal docking/scoring or MD/free-energy checks.\n- No statistical rigor: no replicates, variability estimates, or error bars; qualitative claims about consistency are not supported.\n- Qualitative interface claims (greater burial/hydrophobicity) are not quantified (e.g., buried SASA, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges).\n- Reliance on visual inspection for fold integrity without stability predictions (e.g., FoldX/Rosetta ΔΔG) or expression/solubility proxies.\n- Agents4Science AI involvement checklist (pages 5–8) is internally inconsistent (answers marked [A] but explanations state AI did everything), indicating formal inconsistencies.\n- Compute resources and runtime not reported; reproducibility would benefit from these details."

        "value": "This paper proposes a reproducible in silico pipeline for optimizing TRAIL–DR5 binding via surface-guided mutagenesis and docking, reporting an 8.41% improvement in predicted binding score for hydrophobic mutations. The motivation is clear and the intent to share code and data is positive, but there are major technical and reporting issues. The main concerns include inconsistencies in docking score interpretation, lack of clarity on how improvements and confidence are calculated, and insufficient modeling of the biologically relevant trimeric complex. The experimental design omits key controls such as stability, specificity, and dynamics assessments, and does not cross-validate with known structures or alternative docking engines. Details necessary for full reproducibility, such as exact mutations and computational parameters, are missing, and no repository link is provided. The methodology is standard and the reported improvements are within expected noise, limiting novelty and impact. There are also inconsistencies in the reporting of AI involvement and figures lack necessary detail. While ethical considerations are minimal and limitations are acknowledged, the technical and reporting shortcomings are significant. The reviewer recommends rejection, suggesting substantial improvements are needed in reporting, validation, and methodological rigor to reach publishable quality."

        "value": "This paper presents a computational workflow for optimizing TRAIL-DR5 binding interactions through in silico mutagenesis to enhance apoptosis induction in cancer stem cells. The methodology uses standard computational biology tools and follows a rational workflow, but several technical concerns are noted: only modest improvements in binding affinity are reported, the approach relies solely on rigid docking without molecular dynamics validation, lacks proper controls or benchmarking, and uses confidence metrics that may not reflect biological relevance. The experimental design is limited, comparing only three variants without statistical analysis or error estimation. While the paper is transparent and reproducible, the significance is limited by the modest computational improvements and lack of experimental validation. The work is an incremental application of existing tools, lacking methodological innovation or novel biological insights. The paper is well-written and organized, with appropriate figures and references, but the extensive AI involvement and lack of human oversight raise concerns about the depth of scientific evaluation. Major concerns include limited scope, lack of validation, insufficient statistical analysis, heavy AI reliance, and questionable biological relevance of the results. Overall, the paper demonstrates competent technical execution but lacks the rigor, scope, and validation for publication at a competitive venue."

The writing is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and transparent about limitations, with a strong commitment to reproducibility. However, the scientific content is fundamentally flawed: there is a direct contradiction between the text and data regarding the Electrostatic Mutant, an unsupported quantitative claim about binding improvement, and a lack of essential methodological detail (notably, the specific mutations are not disclosed). The analysis is superficial, considering only three data points without deeper exploration. While the paper is a fascinating demonstration of AI's potential in science, these major flaws render it technically unsound and unsuitable for publication in its current form. Recommendation: rejection, with constructive suggestions for improvement."

        "value": "Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells through high-affinity interaction with death receptor DR5. While TRAIL-based therapies are promising, cancer stem cells (CSCs)—the root of tumor recurrence and drug resistance—exhibit reduced DR5 expression and suboptimal receptor clustering, resulting in diminished apoptotic response. This study presents a transparent, fully reproducible computational pipeline that automates surface mapping, rational mutagenesis, and docking to optimize TRAIL–DR5 binding. Molecular modeling using PyMOL and APBS guided targeted residue mutations, while automated docking with HDOCK established that hydrophobic interface enrichment consistently produced the largest binding affinity gains over wild-type TRAIL, with a maximum improvement of 8.41% and model confidence reaching 93.8%. All code, protocols, and intermediate data are released for independent community replication. This workflow provides a robust template for computational ligand design for resistant cell populations."
