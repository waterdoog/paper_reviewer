        "value": "This paper presents Training Doctor, an automated debugging framework for neural network training that provides real-time detection and resolution suggestions for common training pathologies. The technical approach is well-conceived, with clear mathematical formulations and a coherent four-component architecture. Experimental validation on character-level datasets using nanoGPT demonstrates effectiveness with 100% accuracy on controlled error injections and reasonable computational overhead. However, there are significant concerns: evaluation is limited to small models and character-level tasks, limiting generalizability; there is no comparison with existing debugging tools or baselines; the adaptive threshold scaling lacks theoretical justification; and some experimental claims appear overstated. The paper is generally well-written and organized, but some sections are repetitive and the related work section could better distinguish this work from existing approaches. The problem addressed is important, and the real-time monitoring approach is practically valuable, but the limited evaluation scope reduces immediate impact. The combination of real-time pathology detection with automated fix suggestions is novel, but individual components are standard. The paper provides sufficient detail for reimplementation, but code and data are not available, hampering reproducibility. Limitations are discussed, but potential negative societal impacts are not. Major concerns include limited scope, no baseline comparisons, questionable claims, and the AI-generated nature of the work. Minor issues include figure captions, notation clarity, and speculative future work. Overall, the paper addresses an important problem with a reasonable approach, but the limited evaluation, lack of baselines, and questions about the AI-generated nature significantly undermine its contribution. The core idea has merit, but execution and validation are insufficient for a top-tier conference."

        "value": "The paper introduces Training Doctor, a real-time debugging framework for neural network training that monitors gradients, loss trends, and overfitting, detects pathologies using sliding-window statistics with adaptive thresholds, and provides code-level intervention suggestions with confidence scores. The framework is lightweight, easy to integrate, and shows minimal training overhead (2.7–10.9%) with near-identical final losses to baseline on nanoGPT across four character-level datasets. It achieves 100% detection of synthetic error injections and 95% pass rates on automated component tests. Strengths include practical motivation, simple and interpretable methods, transparent reporting, comprehensive component tests, and structured logging.\n\nHowever, the paper has significant weaknesses:\n- Validation is limited to synthetic error injections, lacking systematic evaluation on naturally occurring pathologies, making real-world utility and false positive/negative rates unclear.\n- No comparisons to standard baselines (e.g., ReduceLROnPlateau, adaptive clipping, AutoML schedulers), so added value over existing practice is unproven.\n- Methodological inconsistencies exist regarding thresholding and confidence scoring, with unclear calibration and training of the ranking model. The application and efficacy of interventions are not demonstrated.\n- Experiments are limited to small models and character-level tasks, with no empirical validation on larger models, other architectures, or settings (e.g., distributed, mixed precision).\n- Reproducibility is undermined by the absence of code and limited statistical reporting.\n- Clarity issues, cross-reference errors, and insufficient analysis of detection sensitivity and calibration further weaken the work.\n\nThe idea is promising and could impact practice, but much of the detection logic is based on known heuristics, and the novelty lies in integration and real-time operation. Without stronger evidence of effectiveness in natural failure modes and rigorous comparisons, the significance is moderate. Ethics and broader impacts are only briefly mentioned.\n\nActionable recommendations include resolving methodological inconsistencies, releasing code, evaluating on natural failures and larger models, comparing to standard baselines, quantifying detection and intervention outcomes, providing sensitivity analyses, clarifying multi-pathology handling, and improving writing quality.\n\nVerdict: A promising and practical direction with a clean, integrative framework, but current evaluation and methodological clarity are not yet at the standard required for acceptance. Stronger empirical validation, rigorous baselines, resolved inconsistencies, and code release are needed."

The system is well-designed, with clear modular components for diagnostics, suggestions, automated testing, and handling concurrent issues. The writing is clear, the motivation is strong, and the potential impact is significant, especially for democratizing deep learning development and reducing wasted resources. The authors are also transparent about the system's limitations.\n\nHowever, the paper's main weakness is the complete lack of source code, making the results unverifiable and undermining the empirical claims. The evaluation is also limited, relying on artificial error injections rather than real-world or more nuanced pathologies, and lacks statistical rigor (no variance or significance measures). While the ideas and system are promising, the absence of reproducible evidence is a critical flaw for a systems paper. The recommendation is a borderline reject, with encouragement to release the code and resubmit, as the work could have high impact if made reproducible."

        "value": "Neural network training failures such as gradient explosion, vanishing gradients, and overfitting are difficult to diagnose in real-time, typically requiring manual log inspection that wastes computational resources and delays development. We present Training Doctor, an automated debugging framework that provides real-time detection, analysis, and code-level resolution suggestions for common training pathologies. The system monitors gradient health, loss patterns, and overfitting through efficient sliding window algorithms and threshold-based detection while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Training Doctor integrates real-time diagnostics, intelligent pattern recognition, automated component testing, and a suggestion engine providing fixes with confidence scores from 0.5 to 0.99. Evaluation on four character-level datasets (shakespeare\\_char, enwik8, text8, gutenberg) using nanoGPT demonstrates 100\\% accuracy detecting controlled error injections and 95\\% pass rates on component tests while maintaining model performance within 1\\% of baseline. The framework adds only 2.7--10.9\\% training time overhead, successfully identifying gradient instabilities, loss plateaus, and overfitting with automated suggestions like \\texttt{learning\\_rate *= 0.5} and \\texttt{dropout += 0.1}, enabling faster iteration cycles and democratized neural network training."
