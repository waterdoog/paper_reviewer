        "value": "This paper presents an AI-first proof-of-concept study investigating how generative AI agents can implement a dialogic Teach-Back protocol for programming education. The study uses GPT-4o to simulate both tutoring agent and student interactions across three different learner profiles, focusing on C++ for-loops. The methodology is clearly articulated, with a well-structured protocol and iterative refinement based on simulation insights. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides comprehensive documentation, including complete interaction logs for reproducibility. The work addresses important challenges in AI-assisted education and offers a novel application of the Teach-Back methodology to AI tutoring in programming education. However, the study's reliance on AI-simulated students rather than real learners significantly limits the validity and generalizability of its findings. The scope is narrow, focusing on a single programming concept and novice learners, and there is no comparison with human tutors. The authors are transparent about these limitations and ethical considerations. Overall, the study is a well-executed proof-of-concept that provides a transparent and reproducible methodology, but its broader impact is constrained by the artificial nature of the evaluation. Future work should include classroom validation, human tutor baselines, broader task coverage, and investigation of transfer to real student interactions."

        "value": "The paper presents an AI-first, design-led proof-of-concept for a dialogic Teach-Back protocol to support novice programmers’ conceptual understanding and metacognition. Using three simulated tutoring sessions (GPT-4o) on a C++ for-loop task, the authors refine their protocol from 5 to 7 phases by adding Slow Thinking, Incremental Probing, and Transfer. A qualitative baseline contrast with GPT-3.5 suggests the protocol increases dialogic engagement and self-correction. The paper is clear, transparent, and well-scoped, with concrete prompts, logs, and figures aiding comprehension. The pedagogical framing is sound, and the design takeaways are practical. However, all evidence comes from AI self-play simulations, limiting external validity. The refined protocol is not evaluated, the scope is narrow, comparative baselines are weak, and the qualitative analysis lacks rigor. Reproducibility is constrained by missing operational details. The contribution is mostly a repackaging of known strategies, with incremental novelty. Recommendations include empirical validation with real learners, stronger baselines and ablations, rigorous qualitative analysis, broader scope, practical deployment details, and situating the work in related literature. The verdict is a borderline reject due to reliance on self-play, lack of systematic analysis, and no evaluation of the refined protocol, though the work is promising with further empirical study and analysis."

        "value": "This paper presents an \"AI-first\" proof-of-concept study on designing, simulating, and refining a dialogic learning protocol called \"Teach-Back\" for novice programmers. The authors use a generative AI agent (GPT-4o) to both enact the role of a tutor and simulate three different student personas interacting with a C++ for-loop task. Through a qualitative, iterative analysis of these simulations, the authors identify common misconceptions and refine their initial five-phase protocol into a more robust seven-phase version. Key refinements include adding a \"Slow Thinking\" phase to encourage deliberation and a \"Transfer\" phase to promote generalization. To demonstrate the value of their structured protocol, they conduct a baseline comparison using a less capable model (GPT-3.5) with and without the protocol, arguing convincingly that the pedagogical structure, not just the underlying model's power, is crucial for fostering a productive, student-centered learning dialogue. The paper concludes by positioning the refined protocol as a transparent, method-driven template for future real-world classroom deployment.\n\nThe submission is of exceptionally high quality and is technically sound for a design-based, proof-of-concept study. The central artifact—the Teach-Back protocol—is well-grounded in established pedagogical principles (dialogic interaction, formative feedback, metacognition). The methodology, while not involving human subjects, is rigorous for its exploratory goals. The use of simulated student personas to iteratively refine the protocol is a clever and resource-efficient approach for this stage of research.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of the evaluation is the baseline comparison. By showing that GPT-3.5 with the protocol yields a qualitatively superior interaction compared to GPT-3.5 without it, the authors provide strong evidence for their central claim: that the dialogic structure is the key active ingredient, transforming the AI from a mere \"answer engine\" into a \"learning partner.\" The claims are appropriately scoped and well-supported by the qualitative evidence presented in the paper and the logs provided in the appendices. The authors' honesty and clarity about the study's scope and limitations further bolster the work's credibility.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written, clearly organized, and a pleasure to read. The abstract and introduction perfectly frame the problem, the approach, and the contributions. Each section flows logically, and the detailed descriptions of the initial and refined protocols are easy to follow. Figure 1 provides an excellent summary of the final protocol, and Figure 2 effectively synthesizes the results of the baseline comparison. The inclusion of verbatim prompts and full interaction logs in the appendices is a model of transparency and greatly enhances the clarity and verifiability of the work.\n\nThe significance of this work is high. As educational institutions grapple with the integration of generative AI, the risk of students offloading cognitive effort is a primary concern. This paper tackles this problem head-on by providing a concrete, actionable, and pedagogically sound framework for designing AI tutors that scaffold, rather than replace, student thinking. The refined Teach-Back protocol is a valuable contribution that other researchers and practitioners can immediately adopt, adapt, and build upon. The central message—that interaction design is paramount—is a crucial one for the field. This work has the potential to significantly influence the design of the next generation of AI-based educational tools.\n\nThe paper demonstrates strong originality. While the Teach-Back method is not new, its detailed operationalization into a multi-phase protocol for a generative AI agent in the context of programming education is a novel contribution. The iterative refinement process based on AI simulations is a creative and effective research methodology. Furthermore, the \"AI-first\" framing, where the AI agent is positioned as a core participant in the research pipeline (from simulation to analysis and writing), is highly original and perfectly suited for the Agents4Science conference. This work pushes the boundary not only of AI in education but also of AI's role in the scientific process itself.\n\nReproducibility is a key strength of this paper. The authors have gone to great lengths to ensure transparency by providing the exact prompts used for both the main study (GPT-4o) and the baseline (GPT-3.5), along with the complete, anonymized logs of all simulated interactions. This allows any researcher with access to the models to replicate the qualitative findings and independently assess the authors' interpretations. This is an exemplary standard for research in this area.\n\nThe authors' treatment of limitations and ethical considerations is outstanding. The dedicated \"Limitations\" section is comprehensive, candid, and self-critical. The authors explicitly acknowledge the most significant weakness—the reliance on simulated students—and clearly state that their findings are illustrative and hypothesis-generating, not generalizable causal claims. They thoughtfully list numerous other constraints and outline a clear and credible plan for future work to address them (e.g., deployment with real students under ethics approval, human-tutor baselines, protocol ablations). This level of honesty and foresight significantly strengthens the paper and the trustworthiness of its conclusions.\n\nThis is an excellent paper that presents a significant and timely contribution. It is a model of how to conduct rigorous, transparent, and impactful design-based research in the age of generative AI. The work is technically sound, exceptionally clear, and highly original. The resulting protocol is a valuable artifact for the community, and the methodological approach is innovative. The authors' candid discussion of limitations is commendable. This paper sets a high bar for work in this area and is a perfect fit for the Agents4Science conference. It is an unambiguous accept, and its quality merits the highest possible rating."

        "value": "Strengths\n1. The application of the Teach-Back method to AI-mediated programming education represents a meaningful contribution, particularly given that this approach remains underexplored in computer science education. The explicit focus on dialogic interaction rather than answer provision addresses a critical gap in current AI-education tools.\n2. The work integrates established theories of Teach-Back, dialogic pedagogy, and metacognition. The protocol is well structured and explicitly documented, making it a useful methodological contribution\n\nWeakness:\n1.  The most critical limitation is that all three \"students\" are AI-generated personas, not actual learners. This creates a severe validity threat: the AI tutor is essentially dialoguing with another instance or simulation of itself. There is no evidence that these simulated misconceptions, reasoning patterns, or learning trajectories reflect authentic novice programmer behavior. The authors acknowledge this as a \"strong assumption\" but the implications are more severe than acknowledged.\n2.  The baseline uses GPT-3.5, whereas the main protocol uses GPT-4o. This conflates dialogic structure with model capability, even though the authors try to control for context carryover \n3. Because the same model both generates the dialogues and helps refine the protocol, there’s a risk of overfitting the design to model idiosyncrasies rather than human learning behavior\n4. The study relies entirely on descriptive analysis. While this is appropriate for a proof-of-concept, some basic metrics (e.g., number of clarifications, protocol adherence, misconception resolution rates) could strengthen claims"
