        "value": "This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding and mitigating 'technostress' induced by generative AI (GAI) agents in the scientific workplace. Building on the established five-dimension model of technostress, the authors introduce novel, GAI-specific sub-dimensions that address the unique challenges of these systems. The framework is logically coherent, rigorously grounded in literature, and highly original, offering new insights such as 'Content Validation Overload' and 'Attribution and Credit Ambiguity.' The paper is exceptionally well-written, clear, and complete for a theoretical work, providing a full arc from problem identification to actionable interventions at individual, organizational, and technological levels. Its significance is high, offering a much-needed vocabulary and structure for addressing the human factors of AI integration in science, and it lays a strong foundation for future empirical research. Minor suggestions include adding a dedicated limitations section and reconsidering the use of the 'Double Helix' metaphor in the title. Overall, this is a landmark, timely, and impactful contribution that is highly recommended."

        "value": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding AI-induced technostress in scientific workplaces. The five-dimensional model logically extends established technostress theory to generative AI contexts, with concrete examples and manifestations for each dimension. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and addresses a timely, important problem. It offers meaningful novelty, especially in identifying AI-specific stressors and sub-dimensions. The framework is detailed enough for others to build upon, and intervention strategies are concrete. Ethical considerations are addressed, but the paper lacks discussion of significant limitations, such as the absence of empirical validation, potential cultural/disciplinary variations, and challenges in implementing interventions at scale. The literature review is adequate but could be broader, especially in connecting to adjacent fields. Major concerns include the purely theoretical nature, limited engagement with criticisms or alternatives, unvalidated intervention strategies, and assumptions of universal applicability. Strengths include addressing an important problem, logical theoretical extension, concrete examples, comprehensive interventions, and clear practical implications. Overall, the paper makes a solid theoretical contribution but falls short of top-tier standards due to lack of empirical grounding and limited literature engagement. It would benefit from pilot validation studies or broader theoretical development."

        "value": "This submission presents a conceptual framework for AI-induced technostress in scientific workplaces, adapting established technostress creator dimensions to the generative AI context and introducing new sub-dimensions. The paper is timely, well-written, and addresses an important topic, offering clear organization, practical interventions, and ethical awareness. However, its originality is limited, as it primarily re-labels existing constructs with incremental extensions. The claims of empirical validation and evidence-based interventions are not substantiated, as no new data or measurement tools are presented. The framework remains qualitative, lacking formalization, operationalization, and testable propositions, which limits its scientific utility. Related work integration and comparative analysis are incomplete, and the paper does not address boundary conditions or heterogeneity across contexts. Actionable recommendations include formalizing the framework, operationalizing and validating sub-dimensions, evaluating interventions, strengthening related work, addressing heterogeneity, and adding visual and tabular artifacts. Minor comments suggest ensuring claim consistency and better contextualization of references. Overall, this is a well-written and timely conceptual essay with practical aspirations, but it lacks sufficient novelty and empirical grounding for acceptance at a top-tier venue. With the recommended improvements, it could become a valuable reference for the community."

This comprehensive study presents a multidimensional theoretical framework for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating AI-induced stressors in the scientific workplace. We expand beyond existing technostress models to address the unique challenges posed by autonomous, generative AI systems that blur the boundaries between human and machine cognition. Our framework delineates five core dimensions of AI-induced technostress: \\textbf{Techno-Overload}, \\textbf{Techno-Complexity}, \\textbf{Techno-Insecurity}, \\textbf{Techno-Invasion}, and \\textbf{Techno-Ambiguity}, while introducing novel sub-dimensions specific to generative AI contexts. Through a systematic review of emerging literature and theoretical analysis, we identify concrete manifestations of these stressors and propose evidence-based intervention strategies at individual, organizational, and technological levels."
