        "value": "We present the \\emph{Band--Pivot Prim} algorithm, a deterministic exact minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm for weighted undirected graphs with arbitrary real weights in the comparison--addition model. \nIn analogy to recent $O(m\\log^{2/3}n)$ single-source shortest path (SSSP) results, our approach removes the classic $\\log n$ priority-queue factor in Prim's algorithm by avoiding the maintenance of a total order over the entire frontier. \nWe group candidate edges into \\emph{bands} by weight, apply bounded expansions from a reduced \\emph{pivot set}, and maintain only a partial order of keys exposed in small blocks. \nFor graphs of constant degree (or after degree reduction), this yields an $O(m\\log^{2/3}n)$ deterministic algorithm in the comparison-addition model, improving over the standard $O(m + n\\log n)$ bound for sparse graphs with arbitrary real weights."

        "value": "The paper proposes a Band–Pivot Prim algorithm for MST in the comparison–addition model, aiming to break the sorting barrier by grouping edges into bands and using pivot-based recursion. However, the technical claims are insufficiently justified, with only sketched proofs and unclear mechanisms for key operations. The model is not precisely defined, and the necessity of addition is not well motivated. The writing is generally accessible, but there are editorial issues and informal algorithmic descriptions. The claimed complexity is not competitive with existing deterministic MST algorithms, and the novelty over prior work is not convincingly established. No code or experiments are provided, and the data structures are not specified in enough detail for reproducibility. The paper lacks a thorough comparison to related work and does not clearly state its limitations. Significant improvements are needed in formalization, clarity, and positioning relative to existing algorithms. In its current form, the paper does not meet the bar for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper introduces \"Band-Pivot Prim,\" a novel deterministic algorithm for the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem, adapting recent techniques from the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem. The main claimed contribution is an improved time complexity of O(m log^(2/3) n) for constant-degree graphs, which would be a significant theoretical advance. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and the core idea is both original and potentially impactful.\n\nHowever, the submission has major weaknesses. The most critical is the lack of rigorous proofs for the algorithm's correctness and complexity; only high-level sketches and intuitions are provided, which are insufficient for a theoretical computer science paper. The algorithmic and data structure descriptions are too vague for reproduction. Additionally, the submission is incomplete, with required checklists left as placeholders, and there is a mismatch between claimed and actual contributions (e.g., an empirical evaluation plan is mentioned but not present).\n\nIn summary, while the idea is strong and the direction promising, the paper is underdeveloped and incomplete, lacking the technical depth and rigor required for publication. I recommend rejection, but encourage the authors to fully develop their work and resubmit."

        "value": "This paper presents the Band-Pivot Prim algorithm, aiming to improve Prim's MST algorithm using band partitioning and pivot techniques for better time complexity. While the conceptual adaptation from SSSP to MST is interesting, the paper has significant issues. Theoretical development is lacking, with only a brief and informal proof sketch for the main complexity result and incomplete proofs for key lemmas. Algorithmic descriptions are unclear, with undefined procedures and insufficient detail for implementation. The paper is poorly organized, with broken section references and a shallow related work section. The contribution appears incremental, relying heavily on prior SSSP work without sufficient innovation for MST. Correctness arguments are informal and incomplete, and the paper lacks experimental evaluation, making reproducibility impossible. The work was almost entirely AI-generated, and the quality does not meet the standards required for theoretical algorithms research. Missing elements include complete proofs, detailed specifications, experiments, proper comparisons, and analysis of practical impact. Overall, the paper reads like an early draft and does not constitute a complete research contribution."
