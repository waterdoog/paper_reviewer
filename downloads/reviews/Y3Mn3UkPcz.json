        "value": "Summary\nThe paper benchmarks four cryptographic hash functions (MD5, SHA-256, SHA3-256, BLAKE2b-256) on throughput and simple “security” proxies (avalanche effect, collision rate among distinct inputs, output entropy) across input sizes and data patterns. It claims to offer an empirical basis for algorithm selection and provides some reproducibility details (environment, seeding).\n\nStrengths\n- Scope and intent are clear; the setup spans multiple algorithms, input sizes, and data patterns.\n- Reproducibility is emphasized (seeded experiments, environment details, claimed code and artifacts), including a reproducibility statement.\n- Responsible AI / limitations sections are present and thoughtful.\n- Figures and tables summarize the main results:\n  - Table 1 (page 3) reports average throughput, with SHA-256 fastest on the measured CPU-only setup.\n  - Figure 1 (page 4) shows throughput and timing vs input size and an avalanche comparison.\n  - Table 2 (page 5) reports avalanche near 0.5, collision rate ~0, and entropy ~0.999 for modern hashes.\n\nMajor Weaknesses\n1) Internal inconsistencies and unsupported claims:\n- The abstract reports numbers that contradict the main results. For example:\n  - Abstract: “SHA-256 achieves 1,809 MB/s” and “BLAKE2b exhibits exceptional avalanche effect at 99.52%,” “MD5 reduced avalanche effect at 25%.”\n  - Main results: Table 1 (page 3) shows SHA-256 at 2,831.20 MB/s; Table 2 (page 5) shows avalanche ~0.5 for all, including MD5 (0.499). The Discussion still claims “BLAKE2b’s exceptional avalanche effect,” which is not supported by Table 2.\n- Table 2’s caption mentions “corrected pipeline,” implying a prior error, but no reconciliation is provided. These contradictions significantly undermine trust in the analysis.\n\n2) Conceptual and methodological issues:\n- The collision-rate metric among distinct inputs is uninformative at this scale; for cryptographic hashes, collisions will be astronomically rare in such experiments, so finding ~0 offers no insight. This is reported in Section 4.3 and Figure 2 (page 5).\n- “Security” proxies are too superficial and at times misinterpreted:\n  - Avalanche effect is correctly expected near 0.5; the abstract’s “99.52%” and “25%” are conceptually wrong for digest-level flipping fractions and contradict the reported results.\n  - No tests for strict avalanche criterion (SAC), bit independence criterion (BIC), or more rigorous statistical batteries (e.g., NIST STS) on digest streams are provided.\n- Memory usage is listed as a performance metric (Section 3.3) but no memory measurements or results are reported anywhere.\n- The “structured” and “edge-case” input patterns are described (Section 3.2) but the results are not disaggregated by data pattern; conclusions focus almost entirely on aggregate numbers.\n\n3) Ambiguity and incomplete experimental detail:\n- The text says “processes 60,000 test vectors” and also “each configuration is tested with 1,000 iterations” (Section 3.5). It is unclear how these quantities relate, and whether totals reflect 60,000 vectors in aggregate or 60,000×1,000 runs.\n- Implementation specifics are not sufficiently documented to interpret performance:\n  - Which Python/hashlib/OpenSSL backends and versions? Are hardware SHA extensions enabled (common on ARMv8) that would bias SHA-256 vs BLAKE2b comparisons? These choices can easily invert relative throughput rankings. The paper notes “absolute values vary,” but does not control or analyze this variability.\n\n4) Related work and citation issues:\n- The paper states “Wang et al. demonstrated practical collision attacks on MD5” but cites a SHA‑0 paper [8] (page 6). The canonical MD5 collision literature (e.g., Wang and Yu 2004; Stevens et al. chosen-prefix attacks) is missing/mis-cited.\n- The related work is minimal and does not situate this study among existing comprehensive hash benchmarks or security property tests.\n\n5) Limited originality and significance:\n- The benchmarking task and metrics are standard; the results largely restate well-known facts (modern hashes have near-ideal avalanche, essentially no observed collisions at limited scales, entropy near 1). Without deeper analysis, cross-platform study, or novel methodology, the contribution is incremental at best.\n\nQuality\n- The presence of contradictory quantitative claims across abstract, results, and discussion, plus a “corrected pipeline” remark without reconciliation, suggests issues with experimental rigor and manuscript curation.\n- Security interpretations (avalanche claims) are incorrect in the abstract and not supported by the reported numbers.\n- Collision-rate testing as configured is not meaningful.\n\nClarity\n- Generally readable, but the contradictions and ambiguities (test vector counts, missing memory results) impair clarity. The discussion’s claim about BLAKE2b’s avalanche effect conflicts with Table 2 (page 5).\n\nSignificance\n- Limited. Similar benchmarks exist; the study does not provide new cryptanalytic insights or a robust cross-platform performance analysis that would change practice.\n\nOriginality\n- Low. The methodology and metrics are standard; no novel framework elements or analytical techniques are introduced.\n\nReproducibility\n- Positive intent (seeded runs, environment details). However, key implementation factors affecting performance are under-specified; memory measurement is not described; and the artifact is not accessible in the submission. The inconsistencies raise concerns about reproducibility of the reported numbers.\n\nEthics and Limitations\n- Responsible AI and limitations sections are appropriate. However, the limitations do not acknowledge the central inconsistencies or the inadequacy of the collision-rate metric.\n\nCitations and Related Work\n- Mis-citation regarding MD5 collisions; limited engagement with broader literature on empirical hash testing and statistical analysis of cryptographic properties.\n\nActionable Suggestions\n- Reconcile all inconsistencies. Ensure the abstract, figures, tables, and discussion report the same (correct) numbers; remove or explain “corrected pipeline.”\n- Correct the avalanche effect discussion; report clear definitions, methodology, and per-bit SAC/BIC analyses with uncertainty (mean ± std/CI).\n- Drop the collision-rate metric or replace it with more informative analyses (e.g., differential behavior under controlled input perturbations, NIST STS on digest streams).\n- Report memory usage with a rigorous method (e.g., peak RSS) and discuss measurement overheads in Python.\n- Disaggregate results by input pattern; discuss any observed deviations.\n- Provide precise implementation details (hashlib/OpenSSL versions, CPU ISA features, whether SHA extensions were active). Consider multiple platforms (ARMv8 with SHA, x86 with AVX2/AVX-512) to make performance findings broadly useful.\n- Fix citations (proper MD5 collision papers; include SHA-1 deprecation and chosen-prefix attacks for context).\n- Consider adding modern algorithms (e.g., BLAKE3, SHA-512/256) and GPU/accelerated backends to increase relevance.\n\nGiven the internal contradictions, conceptual errors, and limited novelty, I cannot recommend acceptance."

        "value": "This paper presents a computational analysis comparing the performance and security properties of four cryptographic hash functions: MD5, SHA-256, SHA3-256, and BLAKE2b-256. While the work addresses a practically relevant topic, there are several significant concerns that limit its contribution.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe experimental methodology is reasonably sound, testing 60,000 vectors across different input sizes (1KB-10MB) and data patterns. However, there are critical issues with the claimed results. The abstract states \"MD5 with reduced avalanche effect at 25%\" but Table 2 shows MD5 avalanche effect at 0.499 (essentially 50%), which contradicts the main claim. The abstract also claims \"SHA-256 achieves superior performance with 1,809 MB/s\" but Table 1 shows 2,831.20 MB/s. These inconsistencies suggest either calculation errors or misreporting of results.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is generally well-structured and clearly written. The methodology section adequately describes the experimental setup, and the framework processes are explained sufficiently for understanding. However, the contradictory results between abstract and tables significantly impact clarity and trustworthiness.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThe work addresses a practical need for hash function selection guidance, but the contribution is limited. Comparing hash function performance is not novel, and the security analysis uses standard metrics without new insights. The findings largely confirm well-known properties (e.g., MD5 vulnerabilities, SHA-256 performance characteristics) rather than providing new discoveries.\n\nOriginality:\nThe work lacks significant originality. Hash function benchmarking has been extensively studied, and this paper doesn't introduce novel evaluation methods or uncover new insights. The combination of algorithms tested and metrics used represents standard practice rather than innovative research.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe paper provides good reproducibility information, including specific Python versions, dependencies, random seeds, and promises to release code. The experimental setup is described in sufficient detail for replication.\n\nLimitations and Ethics:\nThe authors adequately discuss limitations and include a responsible AI statement addressing potential misuse. The ethical considerations are appropriately handled.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. Contradictory results between abstract claims and actual data tables\n2. Limited novelty - essentially a standard benchmarking exercise\n3. No significant new insights beyond confirming known hash function properties\n4. The \"exceptional avalanche effect\" claim for BLAKE2b (99.52% in abstract) is not supported by the data showing 0.499 (≈50%)\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some figures are referenced but the actual performance differences shown are modest\n- The practical recommendations, while sensible, are not groundbreaking\n\nThe paper represents competent experimental work but suffers from result inconsistencies and limited scientific contribution. For a venue like Agents4Science, even with its broader scope, the work needs either novel insights or flawless execution of important practical analysis. This paper provides neither."

        "value": "This paper presents a computational analysis of the performance and security of four well-known cryptographic hash functions: MD5, SHA-256, SHA3-256, and BLAKE2b-256. The authors evaluate these functions based on performance metrics like throughput and security metrics such as the avalanche effect and collision resistance. While the paper is well-structured, clearly written, and includes commendable sections on reproducibility and limitations, it suffers from critical flaws and a significant lack of novelty that make it unsuitable for publication at a competitive conference.\n\nQuality:\nThe technical quality of the paper is severely undermined by a major contradiction and a superficial security analysis.\n\n1. Contradictory Claims about MD5: The abstract states: \"The analysis reveals significant vulnerabilities in MD5 with reduced avalanche effect at 25%, confirming its deprecated status.\" However, the results presented later in the paper directly contradict this claim. Table 2 (page 5) reports MD5's avalanche effect as 0.499, and the text below Figure 2 (line 113) reports it as 0.498. These values are nearly ideal (0.5) and show a strong, not a reduced, avalanche effect. This is a critical flaw that questions the integrity of the entire analysis and suggests a profound lack of diligence in the paper's preparation.\n\n2. Superficial Security Evaluation: The paper's \"collision resistance analysis\" is misleading. The authors report a collision rate of zero for all algorithms, including MD5. While it is true that finding a collision by hashing a few thousand random inputs is statistically improbable, this test does not constitute a meaningful analysis of collision resistance. The known vulnerabilities in MD5 allow for the practical construction of collisions, a fact that is central to its deprecation. A proper analysis would have acknowledged this and explained why their simple test was not designed to find such collisions, rather than presenting a result that could imply MD5 is collision-resistant under their test conditions.\n\n3. Incompleteness: The methodology mentions evaluating \"memory usage\" (line 86), but no results for this metric are presented or discussed in the paper. Furthermore, the captions for Figure 1 and Figure 2 refer to multiple sub-plots ((a), (b), (c), (d) for Figure 1) that are not present in the manuscript, leaving the reader with incomplete and confusing figures.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nThe paper lacks significant originality and its contributions are minimal. The work consists of a standard benchmarking exercise on a small set of very well-understood algorithms. The findings—that SHA-256 is fast on modern CPUs, SHA-3 is slower in software, and MD5 is insecure—are common knowledge in the cryptographic and security communities. The paper does not introduce any novel analytical techniques, evaluate new or exotic algorithms, or provide a cross-platform comparison of sufficient breadth to be considered a significant contribution. The results presented are for a single, vaguely described \"standard hardware\" setup, limiting their generalizability and impact.\n\nRelated Work:\nThe related work section is cursory. It cites the seminal papers for the algorithms but fails to engage with or build upon the extensive existing literature on cryptographic performance benchmarking. A thorough review would have contextualized these new results against prior work, discussing how performance has evolved with changes in hardware and software environments.\n\nClarity and Reproducibility:\nOn a positive note, the paper is generally well-written. The authors should also be commended for the detailed Reproducibility Statement, which specifies the software environment and plans for code release. This is excellent practice. However, the clarity is severely hampered by the inconsistencies and incomplete figures mentioned above.\n\nConclusion:\nIn its current form, this paper is not ready for publication. The critical contradiction in its central security claims for MD5 is a fatal flaw. Beyond this, the work's contribution is too incremental, confirming well-established facts without providing new insights. The security analysis is too superficial to be meaningful. While the efforts towards reproducibility are appreciated, they cannot salvage a study with such fundamental issues in its content and contribution. The paper reads more like a capstone project report than a novel research contribution for a top-tier venue. I must recommend rejection."
