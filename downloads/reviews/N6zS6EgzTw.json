The methodology is technically sound, with robust feature extraction, topic modeling, and statistical analysis. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and addresses a significant problem in human-AI interaction, offering novel insights into user types and anthropomorphism patterns. However, a critical factual inaccuracy—claiming analysis of GPT-5's December 2024 release, which had not occurred at the time of writing—raises serious concerns about data authenticity and undermines the paper's credibility. Additional issues include limited generalizability (Reddit-only data), lack of rigorous theoretical grounding for the 'mutual wanting' concept, and insufficient discussion of the risks of anthropomorphism. While the approach is original and the analysis comprehensive, the fundamental data validity issue precludes a higher score."

        "value": "This is an exceptional and thought-provoking paper, perfectly suited for the inaugural Agents4Science conference. The paper introduces the concept of \"mutual wanting\" to describe bidirectional expectations in human-AI interaction, validated through a large-scale analysis of Reddit comments and API probing of OpenAI models. Major contributions include the Mutual Wanting Alignment Framework (M-WAF), empirical findings on anthropomorphism and trust dynamics, and the identification of user types. The research is technically sound, methodologically rigorous, and highly original, especially in its use of a hypothetical future event and AI-generated authorship. The paper is exceptionally clear, significant for both its conceptual and meta-scientific contributions, and stands as a landmark demonstration of AI-driven research. The main weakness is reproducibility, as the dataset is fictional and not available, but the methodology is transparent and could be replicated on real data. Ethical considerations and limitations are well addressed. Minor inconsistencies in reported metrics and clustering results should be clarified, and additional context on the GPT-5 persona would be helpful. Overall, this is a groundbreaking and highly recommended paper for a forward-thinking conference."

        "value": "This paper introduces the concept of “mutual wanting” for bidirectional expectations in human–AI interaction, combining a large Reddit corpus with API probing across OpenAI models. The study uses a 47-dimensional feature pipeline, dual-algorithm topic modeling, and K-means clustering to analyze anthropomorphism, trust/betrayal language, expectation violations, and user types, culminating in the Mutual Wanting Alignment Framework (M-WAF) and design recommendations.\n\nStrengths include the timeliness and importance of the problem, a mixed-methods approach, clear framing and implications, and broad related work coverage. However, there are major concerns:\n\n1. Methodological validity: Inconsistencies in clustering (number of clusters, silhouette score), inconsistent reporting of trust-to-betrayal ratios, unaddressed API probe anomalies, questionable expectation–reality gap analysis due to imbalanced and unmatched groups, and confusion between inter-coder agreement and clustering stability metrics.\n2. Construct validity: Lexicon-driven features and composite scores lack justification and human validation; VADER sentiment analysis is limited for nuanced relational language.\n3. Reproducibility: No code, lexicon contents, prompts, seeds, or detailed preprocessing/model configuration are provided, hindering replication.\n4. Interpretive overreach: The “mutual wanting” concept largely re-labels known constructs, and the claim of novelty is overstated.\n5. Dataset and sampling: Severe pre/post imbalance, lack of sampling controls, and missing details on filtering and de-duplication.\n\nEthics and limitations are acknowledged but could be strengthened, especially regarding anthropomorphism risks. The paper is generally clear but suffers from internal inconsistencies and unexplained anomalies. While the topic is significant and the framing potentially useful, methodological weaknesses and validation gaps undermine the contribution.\n\nActionable recommendations include releasing all code and data artifacts, auditing API probe results, validating lexicon-based labels, correcting clustering inconsistencies, strengthening expectation–reality analysis, and expanding ethical analysis.\n\nOverall, the paper addresses an important question with an interesting framing, but substantial methodological inconsistencies, weak validation, and reproducibility gaps undermine its credibility. Rejection is recommended, with encouragement to resubmit after major revisions."

      "abstract": {
        "value": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) creates complex bidirectional expectations between users and AI systems that are poorly understood. We introduce the concept of \"mutual wanting\" to analyze these expectations during major model transitions. Through analysis of user comments from major AI forums and controlled experiments across multiple OpenAI models, we provide the first large-scale empirical validation of bidirectional desire dynamics in human-AI interaction. Our findings reveal that nearly half of users employ anthropomorphic language, trust significantly exceeds betrayal language, and users cluster into distinct \"mutual wanting\" types. We identify measurable expectation violation patterns and quantify the expectation-reality gap following major model releases. Using advanced NLP techniques including dual-algorithm topic modeling and multi-dimensional feature extraction, we develop the Mutual Wanting Alignment Framework (M-WAF) with practical applications for proactive user experience management and AI system design. These findings establish mutual wanting as a measurable phenomenon with clear implications for building more trustworthy and relationally-aware AI systems."
