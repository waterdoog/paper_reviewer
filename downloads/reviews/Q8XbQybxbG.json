        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Claims of a 'systematic' analysis lack a documented review protocol (no search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, bias assessment, or PRISMA flow).\n- Cross-modality performance comparisons mix different metrics (accuracy vs. AUROC) and heterogeneous tasks without harmonization or meta-analytic methods.\n- Overgeneralization: ultrasound AUROC 0.94 is drawn from an ovarian tumor meta-analysis (ref. [41]) yet generalized to broad modality ranking.\n- Questionable claim: '0%' MRI diagnostic accuracy by ChatGPT-4 (page 2) is context-specific and conflates general-purpose LMM performance with specialized medical imaging AI.\n- Modality categorization (static/high-contrast vs dynamic/low-contrast) is oversimplified and occasionally inaccurate (e.g., X-ray is typically static; MRI can be dynamic).\n- Possible citation mismatch: the Rayvolve evaluation claim cites [34], which appears to be a general diagnostic accuracy methods paper.\n- Logical tension: attributing ultrasound superiority to temporal information while noting CNNs struggle with temporal features; many cited ultrasound successes are static-frame models.\n- The proposed hybrid workflow (Figure on page 6) is conceptual and not validated within the paper; cited 17% gains are not directly applicable to the proposed setting.\n- No risk-of-bias or publication-bias assessment despite acknowledging such biases in the discussion.\n- Conclusions in the 'Empirical Confirmation of Performance Gaps' (page 7) overstate certainty given the above limitations."

        "value": "This paper presents a systematic analysis of AI performance discrepancies across medical imaging modalities, introducing the 'ultrasound paradox'—the observation that AI models perform better on lower-quality ultrasound images than on high-resolution CT or MRI. The authors attribute this to both data properties and limitations of current AI architectures, and propose a hybrid diagnostic workflow leveraging different modalities and AI strengths for screening and confirmation, with clinicians making final decisions.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written, clearly structured, and addresses a significant topic for medical AI. Its strengths include clarity, organization, a clinically sensible systems-level solution, and a thoughtful discussion of limitations in the field. However, the central premise—the 'ultrasound paradox'—is fundamentally flawed. The comparison is misleading, contrasting specialized AI models on ultrasound with general-purpose models on MRI, rather than comparing like-for-like specialized models across modalities. This undermines the validity of the analysis and conclusions. The review recommends a more nuanced literature review, clear distinction between generalist and specialist models, expanded discussion of advanced architectures, and an explicit section on ethical considerations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper has the potential to be a high-impact contribution, its reliance on a flawed central comparison means it cannot be accepted in its current form. A revision with a robust, like-for-like analysis could make it a strong and valuable paper."

        "value": "The paper presents a narrative review on AI diagnostic performance across imaging modalities, highlighting an 'ultrasound paradox' and proposing a hybrid diagnostic workflow. Strengths include a sensible framing of modality-model interactions, coherent architectural analysis, and a pragmatic workflow proposal. However, the review overgeneralizes key statistics, contains citation mismatches, lacks a systematic methodology (no protocol, inclusion/exclusion criteria, or meta-analysis), and has conceptual inconsistencies in modality categorization. The hybrid workflow is not quantitatively operationalized or empirically validated. Clarity is generally good, but some claims are overstated and terminology imprecise. The significance is limited by methodological weaknesses and overgeneralized conclusions. Originality is moderate, aligning with existing discourse, and reproducibility is lacking due to absence of a protocolized review process. Ethical discussion could be strengthened, especially regarding triage risks and fairness. Citations are broad but variable in quality. Actionable suggestions include making the review systematic, substantiating claims, clarifying modality taxonomy, operationalizing the workflow, strengthening architectural analysis, and expanding on ethics and deployment. Overall, the topic is timely and potentially valuable, but the manuscript requires substantial revision to address methodological and evidentiary gaps. Rejection is recommended in its current form, with detailed suggestions provided for improvement."

        "value": "This paper analyzes performance discrepancies in AI diagnostic systems across medical imaging modalities, proposing a hybrid workflow as a solution. While the topic is important and timely, several significant issues limit the paper's contribution.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe paper is primarily a narrative review that lacks the systematic methodology of proper systematic reviews. The authors make strong claims about AI performance differences (e.g., \"ultrasound paradox\" with AUROC 0.94 vs CT/MRI at 0.82) but provide insufficient methodological details about how these statistics were derived or validated. The evidence synthesis appears selective rather than comprehensive, and many claims lack adequate statistical support. The proposed hybrid workflow, while conceptually reasonable, is presented without validation, implementation details, or performance metrics.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is generally well-written but suffers from organizational issues. The structure jumps between modalities without clear logical progression, and the connection between the analysis and proposed solution could be stronger. Some technical explanations are oversimplified, and the relationship between different hypotheses is not always clear.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nWhile the topic addresses an important clinical problem, the contribution is primarily descriptive rather than providing novel insights or solutions. The hybrid workflow proposal, though practical, lacks novelty and validation. The paper doesn't advance our understanding beyond what is already known about modality-specific AI performance differences.\n\nOriginality:\nThe paper largely synthesizes existing knowledge without providing substantial new insights. The \"ultrasound paradox\" framing is interesting but not sufficiently developed with original analysis. The proposed solutions are incremental and lack empirical validation.\n\nReproducibility:\nAs a review paper, reproducibility concerns center on the methodology for literature selection and synthesis. The paper lacks clear search strategies, inclusion/exclusion criteria, or systematic quality assessment of included studies. The AI involvement checklist reveals heavy AI assistance in writing and analysis, which raises concerns about the depth of human expertise applied.\n\nLimitations and Ethics:\nThe authors acknowledge some limitations in their discussion but do not adequately address the methodological limitations of their review approach. The extensive AI involvement in the research process, while disclosed, raises questions about the depth of domain expertise and critical analysis applied.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. Lack of systematic methodology for literature review\n2. Insufficient validation of key performance claims\n3. Proposed solution lacks empirical support or implementation details\n4. Heavy reliance on AI assistance may compromise analytical depth\n5. Limited novel insights beyond existing literature\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some figures could be more informative\n- Citation formatting inconsistencies\n- Overgeneralization from limited evidence in some sections\n\nThe paper addresses an important topic but falls short of providing the rigorous analysis and validated solutions needed for a high-impact contribution to the field."

      "abstract": {
        "value": "Artificial intelligence (AI) shows immense promise in medical imaging, yet its diagnostic performance varies significantly across different modalities. This discrepancy is highlighted by the \"ultrasound paradox,\" where AI achieves superior performance on comparatively lower-quality ultrasound images (AUROC 0.94) while struggling with high-resolution, complex modalities like MRI (reported accuracy as low as 0%). This suggests that performance is not dictated by image quality alone but by a complex interplay between the data’s intrinsic properties and the structural limitations of current AI architectures. This paper provides a deep-dive analysis of this performance gap by systematically reviewing literature on static, high-contrast (CT, MRI) and dynamic, low-contrast (X-ray, ultrasound) modalities. We investigate the root causes, attributing them to a mismatch between the information type provided by a modality (e.g., spatio-temporal data in ultrasound) and the architectural constraints of dominant AI models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as their limited receptive fields and difficulty in processing temporal features. As a practical solution, we propose a multi-stage \"hybrid diagnostic workflow\" that strategically combines high-sensitivity AI for initial screening (using X-ray/ultrasound) with high-specificity AI for confirmation (using CT/MRI). This approach aims to optimize overall diagnostic accuracy and clinical efficiency. We conclude that the future of medical AI lies not in a single, universal model but in an integrated, collaborative ecosystem that leverages the unique strengths of different modalities and AI architectures to create robust, clinically-relevant solutions."
