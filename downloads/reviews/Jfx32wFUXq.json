        "value": "This paper presents a profound critique of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, arguing that it offers a superficial and non-generalizable view of reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors provide a theoretical framework, grounded in information theory, to formalize the limitations of CoT, such as representational misalignment and mechanistic opacity. As a constructive alternative, the paper introduces two novel, theory-grounded methods: Mechanistic Reasoning Elicitation (MRE), based on causal intervention theory, and Compositional Abstraction Reasoning (CAR), grounded in category theory. The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees for both methods, demonstrating their superiority in terms of information preservation, generalization, and robustness through a series of theorems and illustrative case studies.\n\nThis is an outstanding paper that has the potential to significantly influence the future direction of research on reasoning in AI systems. It is ambitious, theoretically deep, and exceptionally well-written.\n\nQuality and Significance:\nThe technical quality of this work is superb. The critique of CoT is not merely descriptive but is formalized through a compelling information-theoretic argument (Theorem 1), providing a rigorous foundation for the paper's motivations. The two proposed methods, MRE and CAR, are not just incremental improvements but represent a paradigm shift from \"prompt engineering\" to a more principled, mechanistic, and compositional approach to eliciting reasoning.\n\n- Mechanistic Reasoning Elicitation (MRE): Grounding reasoning elicitation in causal interventions on the model's computation graph is a powerful and direct way to move beyond post-hoc rationalizations. The proposed scalable implementations (gradient-based, hierarchical) are thoughtful attempts to address the obvious computational hurdles, and the causal faithfulness guarantee (Theorem 2) provides a solid theoretical underpinning.\n- Compositional Abstraction Reasoning (CAR): The use of category theory is highly sophisticated and perfectly suited to address the challenge of compositional generalization, a known weakness of many neural systems. The formalization of reasoning problems as morphisms in a category and the resulting compositional guarantees (Theorem 3) are elegant and impactful.\n\nThe significance of this work is hard to overstate. If these methods prove to be practical at scale, they could lead to AI systems that are not only better reasoners but are also more interpretable, reliable, and generalizable. This work provides a clear and compelling roadmap away from the brittle heuristics of current prompting methods.\n\nOriginality:\nThe paper is highly original. While it builds upon existing work in mechanistic interpretability and applications of category theory to AI, its synthesis and application are novel. The framing of the problem—as a fundamental limitation of linearized thought chains—and the proposal of these specific theory-grounded alternatives is a unique and insightful contribution that clearly advances the field.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is a model of clarity. Despite the technical depth of the concepts involved (causality, category theory, information theory), the authors present their ideas in a remarkably clear and organized manner. The logical flow from the critique of CoT to the detailed exposition of MRE and CAR is seamless. The use of formal definitions, theorems with proof sketches, and well-chosen algorithms and examples makes the work both precise and accessible to an expert audience.\n\nReproducibility:\nAs a primarily theoretical work, the paper's claims are supported by mathematical proofs and formal arguments. The proof sketches provide sufficient intuition for an expert to verify the results. The case studies in Section 6 serve as excellent proofs-of-concept; they are described with enough detail to understand how the methods are applied and what their outputs look like, which is appropriate for a paper of this nature.\n\nLimitations and Ethics:\nThe discussion of limitations, ethics, and societal impact (Sections 8 and 9, Appendix A) is exemplary. The authors are exceptionally forthright about the challenges their methods face, including the scalability of MRE and the difficulty of defining appropriate categories for CAR. More impressively, they engage in a deep and nuanced discussion of bias amplification, potential misuse (e.g., exploitation of interpretability for adversarial attacks), and equity. The proposal of concrete bias mitigation strategies, complete with new fairness metrics and empirical validation (Table 1), goes far beyond the standard for academic papers and demonstrates a profound commitment to responsible research.\n\nMajor Points for Improvement\n\nThe primary weakness of the paper is the absence of large-scale empirical validation on established reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH, Big-Bench Hard). The case studies are illustrative and convincing, but they do not demonstrate how these methods perform and scale on complex, diverse problems in the wild. While the theoretical contribution is strong enough to stand on its own, the paper would be unassailable if it included even a preliminary quantitative comparison against state-of-the-art CoT variants on a standard dataset.\n\nAdditionally, the practical hurdles for both methods are significant. For CAR, the process of defining the \"reasoning category\" seems to be a manual, knowledge-intensive process. For MRE, the computational cost of interventions, even with the proposed optimizations, is likely to be prohibitive for the largest models. While the authors acknowledge these limitations, future work must focus intensely on making these elegant theoretical constructs practical and scalable.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the lack of large-scale experiments, this is a landmark paper. It provides a brilliant, much-needed theoretical foundation for moving beyond the limitations of current prompting techniques. The intellectual contribution is immense, the technical execution is rigorous, and the vision is transformative. This work sets a new standard for research in LLM reasoning and is a quintessential example of the kind of foundational, high-impact research this conference should champion. It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend a strong accept."

        "value": "The paper presents an ambitious and timely agenda to move beyond chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales in LLMs, proposing two theory-grounded alternatives: Mechanistic Reasoning Elicitation (MRE) and Compositional Abstraction Reasoning (CAR). The work is well-motivated, clearly written, and offers a novel synthesis of mechanistic interpretability and category-theoretic abstractions. It includes high-level algorithms, claimed complexity bounds, and a thorough discussion of limitations and ethics, including concrete bias-mitigation proposals.\n\nHowever, the submission suffers from major weaknesses. The theoretical contributions lack rigor: central theorems are based on informal arguments, unjustified assumptions, and proof sketches that do not establish the claimed results. Key definitions (e.g., \"concepts,\" mappings from hidden states to reasoning chains) are informal, and theorems rely on unproven or implausible assumptions. Empirical validation is essentially absent; despite claims of empirical support, only anecdotal case studies and a fairness table are provided, with no benchmarks, baselines, or reproducible methodology. Algorithms are presented as high-level sketches without sufficient detail for reproduction. The paper overclaims both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation. Related work coverage is thin given the scope, missing several directly relevant areas.\n\nAssessment by dimension:\n- Quality: Promising ideas, but undermined by insufficient rigor and lack of empirical evaluation. Several claims are likely incorrect as stated.\n- Clarity: High-level exposition is clear, but key definitions and proofs lack detail.\n- Significance: Potentially impactful if substantiated, but not demonstrated in current form.\n- Originality: Interesting synthesis, but novelty of MRE over existing tools is not fully precise.\n- Reproducibility: Not sufficient; no code, benchmarks, or methodological details.\n- Ethics and Limitations: Strong discussion, but numeric results are not backed by described experiments.\n- Citations and Related Work: Partially adequate; should be expanded.\n\nActionable recommendations include: re-scoping claims, tightening mathematics, providing empirical validation, aligning claims with evidence, and expanding related work. In conclusion, while the research direction is ambitious and potentially valuable, the submission requires substantial reworking to meet the standards of a top venue and convincingly support its central claims."

        "value": "This paper proposes two alternatives to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Mechanistic Reasoning Elicitation (MRE) and Compositional Abstraction Reasoning (CAR). While the theoretical framework is ambitious and addresses an important problem, several significant concerns limit the paper's contribution.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe theoretical analysis, while mathematically sophisticated, relies on strong assumptions that may not hold in practice. Theorem 1's information-theoretic bound depends on the \"Reasoning Fidelity Hypothesis\" (Assumption 1), but this assumption is never validated empirically. The proofs, while formally correct, make simplifying assumptions about transformer architectures that may not capture the complexity of real LLMs.\n\nThe paper lacks empirical validation of its core claims. While Section 6 provides \"concrete mathematical examples,\" these are illustrative rather than experimental. No actual experiments are conducted to demonstrate that MRE or CAR outperform CoT on standard reasoning benchmarks. The authors acknowledge this is a theory paper, but some empirical validation would strengthen the claims significantly.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is generally well-written but suffers from excessive length and complexity. The mathematical notation is heavy, and key concepts like the \"reasoning category\" in CAR could benefit from more intuitive explanations. The extensive limitations section (Section 8) is commendable but suggests the methods may have limited practical applicability.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nThe core insight that CoT may provide only surface-level reasoning is valuable and the theoretical framework is novel. However, without empirical validation, it's unclear whether these methods would actually improve reasoning in practice. The computational complexity issues (acknowledged by the authors) may severely limit scalability.\n\nTechnical Concerns:\n- MRE's intervention-based approach scales quadratically with model size, making it potentially impractical for large LLMs\n- CAR requires manual definition of categorical structures, which may be domain-specific and difficult to automate\n- The gradient-based approximations in MRE may not accurately capture true causal effects\n- Both methods assume access to model internals, limiting applicability to closed-source models\n\nReproducibility:\nThe mathematical examples are reproducible, but the lack of actual experiments and code makes it impossible to verify the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n\nEthical Considerations:\nThe paper thoroughly addresses potential biases and ethical implications, providing concrete mitigation strategies. This is a strength of the work.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nWhile this paper tackles an important theoretical question about the nature of reasoning in LLMs, it falls short of providing convincing evidence that the proposed alternatives would work in practice. The theoretical contributions are solid but rely on strong assumptions, and the lack of empirical validation is a significant weakness. The computational constraints and complexity of implementation further limit the practical impact.\n\nThe paper reads more like a theoretical exercise than a practical contribution to improving reasoning in LLMs. For a venue that values both theoretical rigor and practical applicability, this work needs stronger empirical grounding to justify its theoretical claims."
