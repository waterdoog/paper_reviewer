        "value": "This paper presents an interesting exploration of AI-conducted systematic literature analysis in multimodal learning research. The premise is intriguing, but the execution suffers from significant methodological issues. The study relies entirely on AI analysis of a curated 75-study dataset without independent validation. Claimed effect sizes lack statistical rigor, with no confidence intervals, significance tests, or proper meta-analytic procedures reported. The computational validation is essentially circular reasoning, and the methodology section lacks sufficient detail. While the paper is generally well-written and organized, the methodology is vague about crucial analytical procedures, and the integration of quantitative and thematic analyses is unclear. The findings are not sufficiently validated to be impactful, and bold claims about theoretical frameworks are based solely on AI interpretation without empirical validation. The use of AI as primary researcher is novel, but the theoretical frameworks presented are more rebranding of existing concepts than genuine innovations. Reproducibility is severely limited due to proprietary AI processes. The authors are reasonably transparent about limitations and AI involvement, but do not adequately address potential biases or overgeneralization. The paper cites relevant literature but does not engage deeply with systematic review methodologies. Major concerns include lack of proper statistical methodology, no independent validation, circular validation, overstated claims, and limited generalizability. Minor issues include inconsistent reporting, lack of error bars, and future-dated citations. Overall, the paper is an interesting proof-of-concept but falls short of scientific rigor required for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper presents a novel and timely study in which an AI agent is positioned as the primary researcher to conduct a systematic analysis of 75 papers on multimodal learning. The methodological contribution—demonstrating the potential for AI to perform end-to-end scientific discovery—is highly original and significant, especially for a conference like Agents4Science. The paper is exceptionally well-written, well-structured, and transparent about its limitations and ethical considerations.\n\nHowever, there are critical weaknesses that undermine its central claims. The most severe is the use of a curated, hand-picked dataset, which introduces a high risk of selection bias and calls the validity of the findings into question. The claims of \"computational validation\" are overstated, as the analysis lacks statistical rigor and does not include significance testing or confidence intervals. The methodology is insufficiently detailed, making the results unverifiable and the work irreproducible. While the concept and framing are highly original, the scientific findings themselves are not robustly supported, and the generated frameworks echo known critiques rather than offering truly novel insights.\n\nIn summary, while the paper is provocative and aligns well with the conference theme, it reads more as a proof-of-concept or position piece than a rigorous scientific study. The fundamental methodological flaws are too significant for acceptance at a top-tier conference in its current form. The work has immense potential but requires a much more rigorous and transparent methodology before its claims can be considered scientifically validated."

        "value": "This study presents the first AI-conducted systematic analysis of multimodal learning research, where an artificial intelligence system independently analyzed 75 peer-reviewed studies to identify previously unrecognized patterns in educational design effectiveness. Through computational analysis of effect sizes across educational domains, AI discovered that optimal multimodal configurations vary significantly by subject area, with domain-specific approaches showing 22-65% larger effect sizes than universal designs. The AI generated and computationally validated three novel theoretical frameworks: Domain-Adaptive Multimodal Design (showing that STEM education requires visual-auditory integration while language learning benefits from gesture-speech combinations), Complexity-Responsive Temporal Integration (revealing that high-complexity content benefits from sequential rather than simultaneous presentation), and Individual Difference Adaptation Models (demonstrating 27-61% improvement when multimodal design matches learner characteristics). These findings challenge the current universal application of multimedia learning principles and provide the first systematic evidence for personalized multimodal learning frameworks."

        "value": "The paper presents an ambitious AI-led systematic review of multimodal learning, proposing three theoretical frameworks and positioning AI as the primary investigator. Strengths include the timeliness of the approach, alignment with learning science needs, and a clear high-level narrative. However, the manuscript suffers from major methodological flaws: lack of meta-analytic rigor and transparency (no details on effect size computation, model choice, study weighting, or uncertainty quantification), unclear data extraction and reliability, absence of a study list or PRISMA-style accounting, and inconsistent scope and operationalization of key constructs. The AI process is proprietary and non-reproducible, and the paper overclaims novelty without adequately situating its contributions in the context of extensive prior work. Statistical reporting is insufficient, with no confidence intervals, sample sizes, or proper handling of confounds. Citations are incomplete, and there are internal inconsistencies in reported numbers and methodology. While ethical risk is low and the potential impact could be high if substantiated, the current weaknesses undermine confidence in the findings. Actionable suggestions include adopting standard meta-analytic protocols, releasing data and codebooks, clarifying operational definitions, improving statistical reporting, and tempering novelty claims. The overall recommendation is rejection, with encouragement to resubmit after substantial methodological improvements."
