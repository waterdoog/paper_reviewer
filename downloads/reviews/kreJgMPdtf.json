        "value": "Traditional AI-driven materials discovery pipelines employ a monolithic architecture where a single surrogate model is trained, scalarized, and deployed statically, creating a brittle interface with physical experimentation. We present a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) that fundamentally redesigns this architecture through three innovative mechanisms: (1) furnace-to-agent feedback loops enabling continuous online learning, (2) a curiosity-annealing scheduler for adaptive exploration-exploitation balance, and (3) memory-injected composition generators that leverage historical success. This architectural approach reduces required physical lab iterations by seven-fold compared to both single-agent and static multi-agent baselines. The system identified 21 novel Pareto-optimal alloys that outperform canonical benchmarks (Ti-6Al-4V, Inconel-718, Cantor HEA) while maintaining 97% metallurgical feasibility. These gains are attributable not to larger models or increased compute, but to specific architectural innovations that enable distributed, adaptive, and physics-informed optimization."

        "value": "This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) for accelerating the discovery of novel alloys, addressing the combinatorial explosion of possibilities and high experimental costs in the field. The proposed system features three key mechanisms: a closed feedback loop between physical experiments and agents, an adaptive exploration-exploitation scheduler, and a memory mechanism to leverage past successes. The system achieves impressive results, including a seven-fold reduction in required lab iterations and the discovery and validation of 21 novel Pareto-optimal alloys, outperforming strong baselines.\n\nQuality: The empirical results are of high quality, with a technically sound and well-motivated core idea. The experimental design is excellent, including head-to-head comparisons, thorough ablation studies, and physical validation of discovered alloys. However, the methodology section is repetitive, confusing, and contains conflicting mathematical formulations and cross-referencing errors, undermining technical soundness.\n\nClarity: While the abstract, introduction, and results are clear, the methodology section is chaotic and redundant, making it difficult to understand the system's implementation. The code snippets are too high-level to resolve ambiguities. A complete rewrite of the methodology section is needed.\n\nSignificance: The work is highly significant, offering a major breakthrough in materials discovery with potential for broad impact in other scientific domains. The discovery of 21 validated, novel alloys is a substantial contribution.\n\nOriginality: The contribution is original, synthesizing known components into a novel, dynamic, hierarchical system tightly coupled with physical experiments. The architectural design represents a conceptual shift in the field.\n\nReproducibility: The authors provide extensive details in the appendices and promise code release, but clarity issues in the methodology section hinder reproducibility.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors responsibly discuss limitations and acknowledge the need for further validation. No ethical concerns are apparent.\n\nConclusion: This is a landmark result in AI-driven materials science, with exceptional significance and empirical strength. However, the methodology section's poor presentation is a serious flaw that must be addressed. Acceptance should be conditional on a thorough revision of the methodology section to ensure clarity and correctness."

        "value": "The paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) for alloy design with several novel features, including a furnace-to-agent feedback loop, a curiosity-annealing scheduler, and memory-injected generation. While the architecture and some experimental procedures are clearly presented, the review identifies numerous critical methodological flaws and inconsistencies. Major concerns include inappropriate use of molecular fingerprints for alloys, mismatches between learning objectives and reported results, invalid update rules for agent learning, undefined similarity/novelty metrics, unsubstantiated claims of outperforming canonical alloys, and insufficient details for reproducibility. The related work is inadequately grounded in the relevant materials science literature, and key physical constraints are not operationalized. Statistical rigor and reporting are also lacking. The paper's significance and originality are potentially high, but the current submission does not convincingly advance the state of the art due to these issues. The reviewer recommends a strong reject, encouraging substantial revision and resubmission after addressing the outlined concerns. Quality is rated low, clarity moderate, significance potentially high if corrected, originality moderate, reproducibility weak, and ethics/limitations only partially addressed."

        "value": "This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) for alloy design, introducing three key innovations: furnace-to-agent feedback loops, curiosity-annealing scheduling, and memory-injected composition generators. The technical approach is coherent, with clear mathematical formulations and a well-motivated hierarchical decomposition. The experimental setup is appropriate, but there are concerns regarding the strength of the claims: the seven-fold reduction in lab iterations is based on potentially outdated baselines, only 3 novel alloys are fully validated, and some metrics lack clear definition. The paper is generally well-written and organized, though integration of the core innovations and experimental protocol details could be improved. The work is original in its combination of techniques, but the individual components are established. Reproducibility is strong, with detailed implementation information and a promise of code release. Ethical considerations are addressed, and limitations are acknowledged. However, the limited experimental validation, unclear generalizability, and some poorly defined metrics weaken the impact of the work. Overall, the paper presents interesting and technically sound ideas, but the experimental evidence is insufficient to fully support its claims."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Objective function inconsistency: Equation (4) rewards higher corrosion while later equations penalize it; this contradicts the problem formulation.\n- Policy/reward inconsistency: Equation (3) rewards similarity to prior successes whereas later sections reward novelty, leading to conflicting optimization pressures.\n- Invalid parameter update: The furnace-to-agent update subtracts a scalar from all parameters (page 6) instead of performing a true gradient-based update as claimed in Equation (11).\n- Incorrect surrogate configuration: XGBoost objective set to multi:softprob for continuous regression targets (hardness, corrosion rate, conductivity), which is inappropriate.\n- Inappropriate features for alloys: Use of ECFP fingerprints and RDKit molecular tooling for alloy composition modeling is methodologically unsound.\n- Ill-defined Bayesian optimization of curiosity: β scheduling via EI on a window of novelties lacks a clear surrogate model and objective mapping; not a well-posed BO setup.\n- Pareto archive update uses predictions: Algorithm 2 inserts predicted values into the Pareto archive, which should be based on empirical measurements in a closed-loop experimental system.\n- Equation numbering and cross-referencing errors (e.g., Algorithm 1 referencing Eq. (12) for gradient update) hamper verification and suggest formal sloppiness.\n- Insufficient physical validation: Only three alloys are reported with experimental measurements (Appendix A5) despite claims of 21 validated Pareto-optimal alloys and a seven-fold iteration reduction.\n- Baseline fairness unclear: Table 1 mixes surrogate metrics with methods that do not train such models; details of data splits, budgets, and experimental parity are missing.\n- Similarity/novelty metric undefined for alloys: Sim(x, x′) not specified; given the use of ECFP, the similarity is likely ill-suited to metallic systems.\n- Some references are off-domain (drug synergy) and do not substantiate materials-specific claims, suggesting weak related work grounding."
