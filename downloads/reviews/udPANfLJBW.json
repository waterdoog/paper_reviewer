        "value": "Detecting precursors of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in long-term ECGs is crucial for timely intervention but remains difficult because precursor signals are subtle and patient physiology varies widely. We present a streamlined framework that adapts a distillation-based vision foundation model, DinoV3, to multi-channel two-dimensional ECG encodings and combines it with an LSTM to form an indicator model for precursor classification. We use three complementary 2D representations—short-time Fourier transform, Gramian angular field, and progressive moving-average transform—to capture time–frequency structure, temporal relationships, and multiscale trends, respectively. Evaluated as a precursor classification study on public long-term ECG datasets, the DinoV3–LSTM pipeline achieves competitive performance despite the absence of ECG-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we outline two concrete next steps to move from precursor classification to clinically useful prediction: ECG-domain fine-tuning with end-to-end optimization, and rigorous lead-time and prospective validation to quantify true prediction capability."

        "value": "This paper proposes using DinoV3, a vision foundation model, for early-stage classification of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) precursors in ECG data by converting 1D ECG signals to 2D representations and combining DinoV3 feature extraction with LSTM classification. The strengths include a novel cross-domain approach, clear clinical motivation, honest discussion of limitations, and a reproducible setup. However, the paper has major weaknesses: limited technical contribution (mainly applying existing models and standard transformations), incomplete evaluation (no early warning results, missing state-of-the-art comparisons, no statistical testing or ablation studies), misleading claims (title/abstract overstate the contribution), weak experimental design (insufficient details, limited baselines, no statistical validation, no analysis of 2D representation contributions), insufficient technical depth (lack of justification for DinoV3, missing processing details, no interpretability analysis), and dataset concerns (small size, no discussion of imbalance or diversity). Minor issues include repetitive writing, unclear figures, and heavy AI assistance in writing. Overall, while the motivation and cross-domain application are interesting, the methodological and experimental shortcomings are significant. The paper only presents preliminary classification results and does not support its broader claims. Substantial improvements are needed in baselines, statistical analysis, ablation studies, prediction experiments, and technical justification. The work is not sufficient for a top-tier venue in its current form."

        "value": "This paper investigates the feasibility of using a pre-trained vision foundation model, DinoV3, as a feature extractor for the classification of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) precursors from ECG signals. The proposed method involves converting 1D ECG signals into three distinct 2D representations (STFT, GAF, PMAT), which are then fed into a frozen DinoV3 backbone. The resulting feature sequences are processed by an LSTM to classify segments into normal, precursor, or event states. The authors position this work as a proof-of-concept for the cross-domain transferability of large vision models to medical time-series data.\n\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written, clearly structured, and provides a thorough background and related work section. The authors are also to be commended for their transparent and comprehensive discussion of the work's limitations and a clear roadmap for future research. This level of honesty and clarity is a significant strength.\n\nHowever, the paper suffers from several critical weaknesses that prevent a recommendation for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\n**Quality:** The technical quality of the work is mixed. While the proposed pipeline is methodologically sound, the experimental results are the paper's primary undoing. The central claim is that the DinoV3-based approach achieves \"competitive performance.\" However, the results presented in Table 1 do not support this claim. The proposed model (F1 score of 0.5489) is substantially outperformed by the 'Trs' baseline (F1 score of 0.6208) and also slightly underperforms the 'FCNwang' baseline from 2017 on multiple metrics (Acc, F1). For a paper whose main contribution is an empirical demonstration, presenting results that are inferior to existing methods significantly weakens the core message. The claim of being \"competitive\" is an overstatement.\n\nFurthermore, there is a fundamental disconnect between the paper's motivation and its execution. The authors rightly criticize prior work for using decoupled training pipelines with frozen feature extractors (lines 46-52), arguing that this \"can restrict task-specific discriminability.\" They propose their framework as a solution that enables \"joint optimization across the entire pipeline\" (lines 56-57). Yet, the actual experiment uses a frozen DinoV3 backbone, thereby replicating the very limitation they set out to solve. While this is acknowledged as future work, it makes the current contribution feel incomplete and preliminary. The paper essentially presents a negative or, at best, lukewarm result for an approach it itself argues is suboptimal.\n\n**Significance:** The potential significance of successfully transferring large vision models to medical tasks is high. However, this paper does not demonstrate that success. The primary takeaway is that using a frozen, off-the-shelf vision model for ECG classification performs worse than existing, more tailored approaches. This is not a particularly surprising or impactful finding. The paper's true value lies in the future work it outlines, not in the results it currently presents.\n\n**Originality:** The application of DinoV3 to 2D-transformed ECG signals is novel. However, the general approach of converting time-series to images to leverage vision models is well-established. The originality is therefore incremental, resting on the specific combination of components and the empirical evaluation, which, as noted, is weak.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper uses public datasets and models, which is good practice. However, it omits several key experimental details. Crucial hyperparameters for the 2D transformations, the LSTM architecture, and the training process (e.g., optimizer, learning rate) are not specified. The paper states that the training procedure follows a reference [9], which is insufficient for a self-contained, reproducible scientific paper. An expert would struggle to reproduce the results precisely without making several assumptions.\n\nIn summary, this paper is a well-written exploration of an interesting idea. Its honesty about limitations is a model for other authors. However, it is ultimately a preliminary study with weak empirical results that fail to support its central claims. The mismatch between the stated motivation (end-to-end training) and the actual experiment (frozen backbone) is a critical flaw. The work feels more like a research proposal or an early-stage progress report than a complete, impactful paper suitable for a highly selective conference. I encourage the authors to pursue the \"next steps\" they have so clearly outlined—particularly the end-to-end fine-tuning—as this would likely lead to a much stronger and more significant contribution."

The approach is well-scoped and uses multiple 2D transforms, but the experimental evidence is thin, with only one comparison table and modest performance. Key methodological details are missing, including data splits, training protocols, and ablations. There are inconsistencies in reporting, such as missing MCC values, and no qualitative or interpretability analyses are provided. The empirical results do not surpass strong baselines, and the contribution is incremental. Reproducibility is poor due to insufficient detail, and broader impacts are not discussed. The paper is appropriately cautious about its claims but lacks the rigor, novelty, and detail required for acceptance. Recommendation: Reject."
