The approach is timely, modular, and emphasizes interpretability, with some evidence of improved performance and robustness. However, the review identifies severe issues: (1) major inconsistencies between claimed and reported datasets and metrics, undermining empirical credibility; (2) insufficient methodological detail for key components, making reproduction impossible; (3) incomplete and mismatched baselines, with no statistical robustness; (4) reproducibility and practicality concerns, including reliance on closed-source models and lack of code/prompts; (5) referencing issues and shallow related work discussion. Minor presentation issues and overloaded terminology are also noted. The reviewer suggests that, if these issues are addressed—especially empirical alignment, methodological transparency, statistical rigor, and stronger baselines—the work could be impactful. However, in its current form, due to critical methodological and empirical flaws, the paper is not recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper presents Map-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for visual geo-localization that combines LLM reasoning with structured geographic knowledge and self-consistency mechanisms. The approach is technically sound and addresses real limitations in LLM-based geo-localization, with a well-motivated three-stage pipeline and clear mathematical formulation. The experimental setup covers appropriate baselines and datasets. The paper is generally well-written and clearly structured, though some technical details are underspecified, such as the VLM fine-tuning architecture, geometric alignment scoring, and BM25 query formulation. The work addresses an important problem and demonstrates meaningful improvements, but the impact is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of combining existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The combination of components is novel for geo-localization, and the multi-chain verification with geometric constraints shows originality, but the overall contribution feels incremental. There are reproducibility concerns due to missing implementation details, such as VLM fine-tuning procedures, GeoSim and GeomAlign functions, OpenStreetMap preprocessing, and parameter tuning. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive with good ablation studies, but lacks analysis of failure cases, comparison to recent state-of-the-art methods, statistical significance testing, and robustness evaluation. Ethical and broader impact considerations are appropriately discussed. Specific issues include the need for more rigorous statistical validation, insufficient detail in some figures, missing recent related work, and unclear multi-chain scoring implementation. Strengths include the novel combination of techniques, comprehensive evaluation, good ablation studies, interpretable reasoning, and transparent AI reporting. Weaknesses are insufficient implementation details, incremental contributions, lack of statistical testing, limited computational cost analysis, and missing recent comparisons."

        "value": "This paper introduces Map-RAG, a novel framework for visual geo-localization that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning. The method addresses key limitations of LLMs in this domain, namely hallucination and poor integration of structured spatial knowledge. The proposed framework operates in three stages: 1) a Visual-to-Text Translator extracts geographic cues from an image, 2) a Map-Grounded Retrieval Agent queries map databases like OpenStreetMap to find candidate regions, and 3) a Multi-Chain Self-Consistency Verifier generates and scores multiple reasoning paths for each candidate, selecting the most plausible location. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, supported by thorough ablation studies and robustness analyses. The work is notable not only for its performance gains but also for producing an interpretable and auditable reasoning pipeline, a significant step forward for explainable AI in spatial tasks.\n\nStrengths:\n- High significance and impact: Tackles the challenging problem of visual geo-localization in GNSS-denied environments, shifting from feature-based matching to reasoning-based approaches, and produces interpretable reasoning traces.\n- Novel and technically sound method: Integrates retrieval-augmented generation, self-consistency, and multimodal AI in a logical pipeline, with clever semantic and geometric verification.\n- Strong empirical results: Substantial improvements over strong baselines across multiple datasets, with significant gains in Top-1 Accuracy, Median Error, and Recall@5.\n- Thorough analysis and ablation studies: Excellent ablation and robustness studies, and effective qualitative analysis.\n- Exceptional clarity and organization: Well-written, clear, and easy to follow.\n\nWeaknesses and Areas for Improvement:\n- Critical inconsistency in dataset reporting: Discrepancy between datasets mentioned in the text and those in the main results table, creating confusion and undermining confidence in the experimental reporting. This must be corrected.\n- Hyperparameter selection: Key hyperparameters are empirically set; a sensitivity analysis would strengthen the work.\n- Discussion of broader impact: A more explicit discussion of the dual-use nature and ethical considerations of geo-localization technology is needed.\n\nRecommendation:\nThis is a high-quality paper with a novel, significant, and well-executed contribution. The proposed Map-RAG framework is a substantial step forward for reasoning-based geo-localization, and the empirical results are impressive. The paper is exceptionally well-written and a pleasure to read. However, the critical inconsistency in the reporting of the evaluation datasets is a major flaw that must be rectified. Assuming this is a correctable oversight, the paper's merits are very strong. The core scientific contribution is solid. For this reason, I am recommending a borderline accept. The acceptance is conditional on the authors thoroughly addressing the dataset inconsistency in the camera-ready version."

        "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising reasoning abilities in multimodal tasks, yet their performance in fine-grained geo-localization remains limited due to hallucinations, insufficient spatial priors, and a lack of structured evidence integration. This paper introduces Map-RAG, a reasoning-augmented framework for visual geo-localization in which an LLM iteratively retrieves structured map knowledge and refines its hypotheses through a self-consistency mechanism. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on embedding similarity or chain-of-thought prompting, Map-RAG integrates three key modules: (1) a visual-to-text translator that extracts geographic cues (e.g., road topology, building style, language on signs) from input images; (2) a map-grounded retrieval agent that queries OpenStreetMap and local gazetteers for candidate regions; and (3) a multi-chain self-consistency verifier that scores and reconciles multiple reasoning trajectories based on semantic-map alignment and geometric feasibility.\n\nExperiments on CVUSA, VIGOR, and MSLS benchmarks demonstrate that Map-RAG achieves significant improvements over baselines in Recall@1 (+6–12%) and median localization error (−20–35%), while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Ablation studies confirm that map-grounded retrieval reduces hallucination, and that multi-chain self-consistency enhances robustness under challenging conditions such as seasonal changes and partial occlusions.\n\nThis work provides evidence that LLMs, when equipped with structured geographic knowledge and verification mechanisms, can serve as explainable geo-localizers in GNSS-denied environments. Beyond performance gains, Map-RAG contributes an auditable reasoning pipeline, aligning with the broader goal of transparent and reproducible AI for scientific discovery."
