        "value": "The paper introduces Multimodal Representation Engineering (MRepE), a framework for identifying, aligning, and intervening on concept-specific internal representations across modalities (text, image, audio) to improve alignment, safety, and controllability. The approach includes causal/activation-based representation identification, learned cross-modal mapping functions, direct vector-based and attention-masking interventions, and new evaluation metrics. Experiments on CLIP, BLIP-2, and GPT-4V report large gains in interpretability, consistency, safety, and robustness with modest compute overhead.\n\nStrengths:\n- Tackles a timely and important problem: multimodal interpretability and alignment.\n- Clear decomposition of the framework (identification, mapping, intervention, evaluation).\n- Comprehensive evaluation attempts, including ablations and compute reporting.\n- If validated, the claimed safety gains would be impactful.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1) Feasibility and correctness: The paper claims interventions on GPT-4V internals, which is infeasible due to its closed-source nature. Audio alignment is evaluated on models not designed for audio without specifying the necessary modifications. Large-scale AudioSet training is reported as modest in compute without sufficient detail.\n2) Insufficient methodological detail: Key aspects such as representation identification, cross-modal mapping, interventions, and metric definitions are underspecified, making reproducibility and validity questionable.\n3) Questionable validity of results: Large gains are reported without granular evidence or robust statistical analysis. Key terms and datasets are undefined or unreleased, raising concerns about construct validity and cherry-picking.\n4) Related work and positioning: The paper lacks comparison to strong baselines and recent defenses, and the originality is incremental.\n5) Reproducibility and transparency: No code or data release, reliance on closed models, and underspecified protocols hinder independent verification.\n\nClarity: The paper is generally well organized and readable, but missing critical implementation details prevent replication and rigorous assessment.\n\nEthics and limitations: While limitations and safety are discussed, potential misuse, fairness, and mitigation strategies are not analyzed in depth, and safety claims lack rigorous evaluation.\n\nActionable Suggestions:\n- Use open LMMs for interventions and specify technical details.\n- For audio, use appropriate models or clearly describe added components.\n- Fully define and release metrics and datasets.\n- Provide concrete algorithms and qualitative analyses.\n- Expand baselines and strengthen statistical analysis.\n- Release code and detailed logs for replication.\n\nOverall assessment: The topic is important and the framework is promising, but the current version has fundamental feasibility issues, lacks critical methodological detail, and presents unconvincing results. Substantial revisions and a rigorous, reproducible open-model evaluation are required for acceptance."

        "value": "I have carefully reviewed this paper on \"Multimodal Representation Engineering for Robust AI Alignment\" and will evaluate it across the key dimensions.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe paper presents a technically sound framework for extending Representation Engineering to multimodal AI systems. The methodology is well-structured with clear mathematical formulations (Equations 1-11) and a comprehensive four-component framework covering representation identification, cross-modal alignment, intervention design, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design is robust, testing on three state-of-the-art models (CLIP, BLIP-2, GPT-4V) with appropriate baselines and statistical analysis including error bars and significance tests.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized. The abstract and introduction effectively communicate the research goals and contributions. The methodology section provides sufficient mathematical detail, and the experimental setup is comprehensively described. The results are presented with clear tables and statistical measures. The writing quality is high throughout.\n\nSignificance and Impact:\nThis work addresses an important and timely problem in AI safety - extending representation engineering techniques to multimodal systems. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: 20-25% gains in representation identification, 25% improvement in cross-modal consistency, 33.8% improvement in overall safety score, and 34.2% reduction in harmful outputs. These are significant achievements that could have meaningful impact on multimodal AI alignment.\n\nOriginality:\nThe extension of RepE to multimodal settings is novel and represents a meaningful contribution. The cross-modal alignment functions, combined intervention strategies (direct + attention-based), and comprehensive evaluation metrics are innovative approaches. The work builds appropriately on existing literature while introducing new techniques.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe paper provides excellent reproducibility information including detailed experimental setups, hyperparameters, datasets, and statistical procedures. The authors honestly acknowledge that code/data are not available due to resource constraints and proprietary model access, which is acceptable given the nature of the work.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors demonstrate excellent awareness of limitations, dedicating substantial discussion to computational requirements, architecture dependencies, potential side effects, and evaluation limitations. The broader impacts are appropriately discussed, and the work clearly aims to improve AI safety. The AI involvement checklist is transparent about the role of AI in generating the paper content.\n\nCitations and Related Work:\nThe related work section is comprehensive and appropriately positions the work within existing literature. Citations appear accurate and relevant.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some mathematical notation could be clearer (e.g., the relationship between different representation spaces)\n- The computational overhead analysis could be more detailed\n- Some experimental details could benefit from additional discussion\n\nOverall Assessment:\nThis is a high-quality paper that makes significant contributions to an important area of AI safety research. The methodology is sound, the experiments are comprehensive, and the results are impressive. The authors demonstrate appropriate scientific rigor, acknowledge limitations honestly, and present their work clearly. The extension of representation engineering to multimodal settings fills an important gap and provides a foundation for future work in multimodal AI alignment.\n\nThe paper represents solid technical work with clear practical implications for AI safety. While there are minor areas for improvement, the overall contribution is substantial and the execution is of high quality."

        "value": "This paper proposes a novel framework, Multimodal Representation Engineering (MRepE), to extend Representation Engineering from text-only models to multimodal AI systems, aiming to improve alignment, safety, and controllability for models processing text, images, and audio. The framework includes four components: identifying concept-specific representations across modalities, learning cross-modal alignment functions, designing intervention mechanisms, and introducing new evaluation metrics. Experiments on models like CLIP, BLIP-2, and GPT-4V show significant improvements over strong baselines.\n\nStrengths:\n- The problem is highly significant and timely for AI safety and alignment.\n- The framework is technically sound, novel, and synthesizes established techniques in a non-trivial way.\n- Evaluation is exceptionally thorough, covering multiple models, strong baselines, comprehensive metrics, and includes ablation and efficiency analyses.\n- The paper is clear, well-organized, and transparent about its limitations.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The main weakness is the lack of publicly available code and data, which limits reproducibility.\n- There is limited exploration of negative side effects from interventions; more analysis of potential unintended consequences would strengthen the work.\n\nOverall, this is an outstanding, technically deep, and empirically rigorous paper. The MRepE framework is novel and impactful, and the experiments convincingly demonstrate its effectiveness. Despite minor concerns about code availability, the paper's strengths are overwhelming, making it a clear candidate for acceptance at a top-tier conference. Strongly recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "This research proposes to extend the concept of Representation Engineering (RepE) to multimodal AI systems, addressing the growing complexity and potential risks associated with advanced AI models that process various input types (e.g., text, images, audio). The study aims to develop techniques for analyzing and manipulating high-level representations across different modalities, enabling more precise control and interpretation of multimodal AI behaviors. We present a comprehensive framework that involves: (1) identifying and mapping cross-modal representations in large multimodal models, (2) developing methods to intervene and modify these representations to align with desired outcomes, (3) creating evaluation metrics for multimodal alignment and safety, and (4) investigating the transferability of representation engineering techniques across different multimodal architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the transparency, controllability, and safety of multimodal AI systems across various benchmarks. This work has the potential to significantly contribute to the broader goal of aligning advanced AI with human values and intentions, providing a foundation for more reliable and interpretable multimodal AI systems."
