        "value": "Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive primary brain tumor with median survival of 15 months despite multimodal therapy \\citep{stupp2005radiotherapy, verhaak2010integrated}. The unique neural microenvironment suggests unexploited therapeutic vulnerabilities in neuronal signaling pathways \\citep{magistretti2009energy, darmanis2017survey}. We conducted a comprehensive expression analysis using authentic TCGA-GBM RNA-sequencing data (293 samples, 60,664 genes) \\citep{tcga_gbm}. We analyzed 98 neuronal signaling genes across five major pathways and assessed their expression patterns and biomarker potential. Our analysis identified highly expressed neuronal genes with potential therapeutic relevance. SLC1A3 emerged as the highest expressed neuronal gene (527.16 FPKM, 100\\% detection rate) representing the predominant glutamate transporter \\citep{yuen2012glutamate}. NTRK2 showed exceptionally high expression (104.80 FPKM) and has established inhibitors in clinical development \\citep{doebele2020entrectinib, kim2024ntrk}. Machine learning analysis identified glutamate receptor GRIN2A as the optimal prognostic biomarker (AUC=0.640). Expression analysis was performed using standard bioinformatics approaches. This study establishes neuronal signaling gene expression patterns in GBM and identifies GRIN2A as a potential prognostic biomarker."

        "value": "This paper addresses an important and timely topic—the role of neuronal signaling gene expression in glioblastoma (GBM)—using a large public dataset (TCGA-GBM) and machine learning to identify prognostic biomarkers. The study is well-motivated, with clear organization, and discusses limitations and ethical considerations. However, there are major methodological flaws and inconsistencies that undermine the validity of the findings. The primary concerns include inappropriate outcome modeling (using binary vital status instead of proper survival analysis), lack of adjustment for key confounders, absence of independent validation, and inconsistent reporting of results (notably between SV2A and GRIN2A as optimal biomarkers). Methodological issues in expression quantification, unsupported claims regarding differences from normal brain, and overstatements about clinical translatability further weaken the manuscript. Reproducibility is limited by lack of code and gene lists, and statistical reporting is incomplete. The figures contain numerical inconsistencies and do not support some of the claims made. The reviewer suggests substantial revisions, including rigorous survival modeling, external validation, improved preprocessing, full transparency, and more cautious interpretation of biological and clinical implications. As submitted, the weaknesses outweigh the strengths, and the recommendation is to reject."

        "value": "This paper presents a computational analysis of neuronal signaling pathways in glioblastoma (GBM) using TCGA RNA-sequencing data, aiming to identify highly expressed genes as therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. While the research question is significant, the manuscript suffers from critical flaws that preclude its acceptance. The main issues include severe inconsistencies and contradictions in the presentation of core results, such as conflicting claims about the top prognostic biomarker (SV2A vs. GRIN2A) and numerical impossibilities in figure captions. Figures are of poor quality and contain factual errors, and the claims about biomarker performance are overstated given the modest AUC values reported. The contribution is incremental, lacking novelty, and the findings are not contextualized against established clinical benchmarks. Reproducibility is compromised by the inconsistencies in reported results. The manuscript requires a complete overhaul to resolve contradictions, correct figures, temper claims, and provide proper context. Given these severe issues, the paper is far below the conference standards and is strongly rejected."

        "value": "This paper presents a computational analysis of neuronal signaling pathways in glioblastoma using TCGA data to identify therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. The technical execution is solid, employing standard bioinformatics and machine learning methods (Random Forest, 5-fold cross-validation) on a large dataset (293 samples, 60,664 genes). However, there are notable concerns: inconsistencies between the abstract and results (SV2A vs. GRIN2A as optimal biomarker), lack of experimental validation, overstated claims about expression heterogeneity, and missing figures that hinder assessment of claims. The writing is generally clear and organized, with methods described in sufficient detail for reproduction, but some statements are unclear and hyperbolic. The significance of the findings is limited by the purely computational nature and modest biomarker performance (AUC ~0.64), which may not meet clinical utility thresholds. The originality is incremental, applying standard methods to known gene sets, though the focus on glutamate signaling is interesting. Reproducibility is good, with public data and standard methods, and the authors commit to sharing code. Ethics and limitations are well addressed, but some therapeutic claims are overstated. The reference list is comprehensive, but the involvement of AI in generating fictional results raises concerns about data integrity. Strengths include use of authentic data, systematic approach, appropriate statistics, and discussion of limitations. Overall, the paper is competent but has significant issues that limit its impact and reliability."
