        "value": "This paper introduces the Emotion Specificity Index (ESI), an entropy-based metric to quantify how specifically an emoji is associated with a discrete emotion versus being emotionally ambiguous. The ESI is applied to the EmojiDis dataset (112 emojis, 13 emotions, Spanish speakers). Key findings include: (1) ESI captures a spectrum from specific to ambiguous emojis; (2) negative emojis are more specific than positive/neutral ones; (3) valence is the main axis of emotional variation; (4) ESI is negatively correlated with valence. The paper is praised for its sound methodology, clarity, and significant, original contribution. The ESI is seen as a valuable tool for research and practical applications. Minor weaknesses include a generic and error-prone Figure 1, limited generalizability due to a single-language dataset, and a lack of formal statistical significance tests for some findings. These are minor, and the paper is strongly recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper introduces an entropy-based emotion specificity index (ESI) to quantify how concentrated emoji ratings are for discrete emotions using the EmojiDis dataset. While the basic idea of applying Shannon entropy to measure emotional specificity is reasonable, the paper suffers from several significant weaknesses that limit its contribution.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe technical approach is straightforward but lacks depth. The ESI is simply a normalized entropy measure - while this is mathematically sound, it's not particularly novel. The baseline correction (subtracting 1 and clipping negatives to zero) is poorly justified and could introduce artifacts. The paper would benefit from comparing alternative normalization approaches or validating this choice.\n\nThe analysis is largely descriptive rather than providing deep insights. The finding that negative emojis are more specific than positive ones is intuitive and not particularly surprising given existing literature on emotion recognition.\n\nMethodological Concerns:\nThe reliance on a single dataset from Spanish speakers severely limits generalizability. Cross-cultural validation would be essential given known cultural differences in emoji interpretation. The paper acknowledges this limitation but doesn't adequately address how this affects the utility of the proposed index.\n\nThe correlation analysis and PCA are standard techniques that don't provide novel insights beyond confirming expected valence-arousal relationships already established in the literature.\n\nReproducibility and Ethics:\nWhile the authors claim reproducibility through a ChatGPT link, this is problematic for several reasons: (1) ChatGPT conversations are not permanent or reliable sources, (2) the model versions change over time, and (3) this doesn't constitute proper code/data sharing. The paper needs proper code repositories and detailed methodological descriptions.\n\nThe AI involvement checklist reveals that essentially the entire paper was generated by GPT-5, with minimal human oversight. While this fits the conference's scope, it raises questions about the depth of human expertise and validation of the results.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nThe contribution is incremental. Applying entropy measures to emoji data is a logical extension of existing work but doesn't represent a significant methodological advancement. The applications discussed (marketing, health communication) are speculative and not empirically validated.\n\nThe paper doesn't adequately differentiate itself from existing emoji sentiment analysis work or demonstrate clear advantages over simpler approaches like standard deviation or range measures of emotion ratings.\n\nClarity and Organization:\nThe paper is generally well-written but could benefit from more critical analysis of limitations and alternative approaches. The figures are informative but don't reveal insights beyond what's already known about emoji valence patterns.\n\nMissing Elements:\n- Validation against human judgments of ambiguity\n- Comparison with alternative specificity measures\n- Cross-cultural validation\n- Empirical testing of proposed applications\n- Statistical significance testing of key findings\n\nThe work represents a competent but limited analysis that doesn't advance our understanding of emoji interpretation in meaningful ways. While technically sound, it lacks the novelty, depth, and validation needed for a strong scientific contribution."

        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Ambiguity in probability definition: \"over all nonzero adjusted ratings\" (p. 2) risks undefined cases if all adjusted means are zero and creates inconsistency about whether zero-probability categories are included in entropy.\n- Entropy normalization: Using log(13) as the denominator even when some categories have p_i = 0 biases ESI and breaks the interpretation of minimum/maximum; consider including all 13 categories with 0 log 0 = 0 or normalizing by log(m) where m is the effective support.\n- Unexpectedly narrow ESI range (max ≈0.233; p. 3) is at odds with the [0,1] scale and the interpretation of \"high specificity\"; investigate potential miscalibration, preprocessing effects, or confirm calculations.\n- Baseline handling: Subtracting 1 from 1–5 Likert means ensures nonnegativity, so the stated \"clipped negative values to zero\" (p. 2) is redundant or indicates an implementation mismatch that should be clarified.\n- No uncertainty quantification: ESI, correlations, and category comparisons lack standard errors/confidence intervals; no hypothesis tests reported for claims such as higher specificity in negative emojis.\n- Reliance on item-level means ignores within-emoji participant variability; bootstrapping over raters or using full distributions would enable uncertainty estimates for ESI and robustness checks.\n- Group/category comparisons (Figure 4, p. 7) lack error bars or statistical tests; claims are descriptive only.\n- Minor internal inconsistencies in results presentation: Table 1 (p. 3) includes duplicate category entries and does not fully match the emojis described in the text.\n- Edge-case handling not specified: what happens if ∑ r_i = 0 for an emoji (division by zero)? A defined fallback (e.g., ESI set to 0 or treated as missing) should be stated.\n- Correlation r = −0.46 (p. 3) is reported without p-value or CI; add inferential stats for completeness."

The method is principled, transparent, and replicates known valence structure, with clear motivation and practical applications. However, there are significant methodological concerns: the normalization of ESI is inconsistent and may induce scaling artifacts, the empirical ESI range is highly compressed (raising interpretability issues), and statistical rigor is lacking (no p-values, CIs, or robustness checks). Validation against external norms and alternative specificity measures is missing, and the conceptual alignment between ESI and true ambiguity is not fully addressed. Presentation issues (table clarity, typos) and limited novelty further weaken the contribution. The dataset is public and the approach is reproducible, but more detail and code would help. Overall, this is a well-motivated but methodologically underdeveloped paper; with substantial revisions and stronger validation, it could become a solid reference, but in its current form, it is borderline reject."

        "value": "Emojis are ubiquitous in digital communication, yet their emotional meanings are\noften ambiguous.  A recently released normative data set provides mean ratings of\n112 emojis on 13 discrete emotions in Spanish speakers.  Based on\nstudies demonstrating that many emoji do not unambiguously depict a single\nemotion, we introduce an entropy-based emotion specificity index (ESI)\nto quantify how concentrated the ratings of an emoji in one emotion.  After\nbaseline correction, we compute Shannon’s entropy across the 13 emotion\nratings and normalize it by the maximum possible entropy.  Low values of ESI\nindicate ambiguous or neutral emojis, whereas high values reflect a strong\nassociation with a single emotion.  Our analyzes reveal that negative emojis\nshow greater specificity than positive or neutral ones, that the principal component\nanalysis recovers a valence continuum explaining nearly 73% of the variance,\nand that ESI is systematically related to affective valence.  We discuss\napplications of the ESI in marketing, health communication, and mental health\nmonitoring and situate our findings within emerging normative datasets and\ncross‑cultural research on emoji interpretation."
