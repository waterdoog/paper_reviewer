        "value": "This paper presents an AI-generated review on artificial intelligence applications in endoscopic diagnosis of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). While the clinical topic is highly relevant and the review covers important advances in medical AI, there are significant concerns about the paper's contribution and methodology. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in ESCC diagnosis, with accurate clinical data and performance metrics, but it is essentially an AI-generated synthesis of existing work rather than original research. The lack of novel insights, critical analysis, or methodological contributions significantly undermines its academic value. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, but some sections are repetitive and lack nuanced analysis. The most serious challenge is the lack of critical insights, novel perspectives, and expert interpretation, making the contribution automated content aggregation rather than scholarly analysis. The methodology is literature aggregation and AI synthesis, not scientific research. While the authors are transparent about AI involvement and limitations, this transparency raises questions about whether the work should be published at all. Critical concerns include the lack of scholarly work, critical analysis, and expert interpretation, as well as the precedent set for AI-generated publications without clear added value. The verdict is that, despite the important topic and transparency, the paper represents sophisticated plagiarism detection avoidance rather than genuine scholarly contribution, and the extensive limitations argue against publication."

        "value": "This narrative review addresses artificial intelligence for endoscopic diagnosis of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), summarizing single- and multimodal systems, real-time video approaches, lesion margin delineation, microvascular classification, and invasion-depth prediction. It collates performance ranges, contrasts architectures and validation settings, and discusses limitations and clinical translation prospects. The review is clinically grounded and summarizes major studies accurately, highlighting key challenges and aligning them with technical choices. However, it lacks methodological rigor: there is no stated literature search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, or risk-of-bias assessment, making selection bias likely. Citations contain errors and gaps, with some references missing or tangential, undermining credibility. Quantitative comparisons lack standardized definitions and statistical rigor, and the synthesis is unstructured. The clinical translation section is superficial, omitting regulatory, deployment, and workflow details. The only figure is an AI-writing flowchart, not related to the scientific content. The review is readable but dense, lacking summary tables and clear organization. While the topic is important and the overview useful, the absence of systematic methodology and structured synthesis limits its impact and suitability as a reference. Originality is limited to synthesis and framing, with missed opportunities for novel frameworks or taxonomies. The review includes a limitations discussion and responsible AI statement but could deepen its treatment of clinical AI ethics. Major works are referenced, but citation coverage and dataset summaries are incomplete. Actionable suggestions include adopting systematic review methods, structured evidence synthesis, citation improvements, deeper clinical translation discussion, a translational framework, expanded bias analysis, improved scope, and better structure. Overall, the manuscript covers a key topic and collates relevant studies, but lacks the rigor, citation accuracy, and synthesis required for acceptance at a high-standard venue. Substantial revisions are needed."

The review synthesizes deep learning model performance, compares it to physician results, and discusses clinical advantages and bottlenecks. Notably, the review itself was primarily generated by an AI agent, with human oversight, and the process is transparently documented. \n\nThe submission is outstanding, excelling in quality, clarity, significance, originality, reproducibility, ethics, and citation of related work. The synthesis of literature is accurate and insightful, with clear structure and logical flow. The paper is significant both for its comprehensive review and as a pioneering demonstration of AI-driven scientific writing, directly addressing the conference's core theme. The authors are exemplary in their discussion of limitations and ethical considerations, providing a candid analysis of their AI agent's weaknesses and societal impacts. Citations are strong, though one reference is incomplete. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a superb, landmark contribution that sets a high standard for future work in AI-assisted science. I recommend Strong Accept with enthusiasm."

Despite advances in imaging technology, clinical challenges remain, including missed diagnosis of flat lesions and subjective variability among physicians. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated transformative potential in endoscopic diagnosis, offering an effective solution to overcome existing bottlenecks and improve the accuracy of early ESCC identification. This article systematically reviews the clinical value of artificial intelligence in ESCC detection, classification, and invasion depth prediction, aiming to identify the technical advantages, bottlenecks in clinical translation, and future research directions."
