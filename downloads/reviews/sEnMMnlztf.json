        "value": "The paper proposes an AI-assisted framework for evaluating unconventional unified theories in physics, applying it to a nonstandard \"Unified Field Theory\" (UFT) attributed to Zhang. The framework includes pseudo-code for scoring coverage, parsimony, and predictive power, a consistency checker, and an experiment designer. The case study claims high coverage, strong parsimony, and bold predictions, positioning UFT favorably against the Standard Model.\n\nStrengths include a timely and ambitious goal, clear motivation, and a reasonable conceptual structure. However, there are major concerns:\n\n1. The physics case study lacks technical rigor, with nonstandard and inconsistent equations, unsupported claims, and subjective comparative metrics.\n2. The AI framework is under-specified, with undefined and subjective key functions, naive parsimony metrics, and unvalidated distinguishing power scores.\n3. The work is not reproducible: code is pseudo-code, data sources are unspecified, and no experiments are executed.\n4. Scholarship is weak, with poor engagement with relevant literature and empirical constraints.\n5. The framework risks bias, potentially legitimizing weak theories, and does not address the negative societal impact of promoting unverified claims.\n\nDimension-by-dimension, the quality is low, clarity is moderate, significance is potentially high in concept but undermined by execution, originality is limited, reproducibility is low, and ethical safeguards are insufficient.\n\nRecommendations include formalizing metrics, implementing and validating the framework, grounding experimental design, strengthening case studies, engaging with relevant literature, and adding ethical safeguards.\n\nConclusion: The paper's vision is compelling, but the execution lacks rigor, validation, and credibility. The physics case study is flawed, and the AI framework is not operationalized. Rejection is recommended in its current form, with hope for substantial rework."

        "value": "This paper proposes an AI-assisted framework for evaluating scientific theories, using Zhang XiangQian's Unified Field Theory (UFT) as a case study. While the problem of institutional bias against unconventional theories is important, the paper is critically flawed in both methodology and technical substance. The UFT case study is fundamentally unsound, with dimensionally inconsistent equations, undefined and meaningless concepts, and ad-hoc, non-standard formulations. The AI framework is superficial, presented as pseudo-code that glosses over the genuinely difficult problems, with no technical details or implementation provided. The analysis results are not credible outputs of an AI system. The work's significance is negative, as it risks legitimizing pseudoscience and undermines the goal of democratizing theory evaluation. The originality is low, as the approach is a simplistic collection of heuristics lacking technical depth. The paper is not reproducible, with incomplete code and missing data sources. While clearly written, the clarity is misleading, presenting flawed work as rigorous. The citations are inappropriate, relying on non-peer-reviewed sources, and the paper fails to engage with relevant literature. In conclusion, the paper mimics scientific structure but lacks technical soundness, honesty, and evidence, and risks damaging the credibility of AI for science. It falls far below the standards of any serious scientific venue."

Using Zhang XiangQian’s Unified Field Theory (UFT) as a test case, we demonstrate how\nmachine learning can objectively assess explanatory power, generate testable predictions, and\ndesign optimal experiments to distinguish between competing paradigms. Our framework ad-\ndresses the systematic bias against unconventional theories by focusing on explanatory breadth,\nmathematical consistency, and empirical distinguishability rather than institutional credentials.\nResults show that AI can identify novel experimental approaches and theoretical connections\nthat human researchers might overlook due to paradigmatic constraints."

(2) mass definition m = k n/(4π) lacks derivation and unit balance; k’s dimension is unspecified.\n- Field expressions (page 4) introduce Ω and dΩ/dt into E and B with inconsistent units and no derivations from established physics.\n- Prediction A = −(1/c^2) a × E (page 5) is not a recognized GR/EM result and is dimensionally inconsistent for a gravitational field.\n- Explanatory coverage (0.875, Listing 4) is computed from subjective booleans (e.g., explains_via_*) rather than objective criteria or data.\n- Parsimony metric 1/(assumptions + free_parameters) is ad hoc; comparison of 2 ‘assumptions’ to 19 SM parameters is not methodologically sound.\n- Predictive power defined as a simple count of ‘novel’ predictions lacks operational definition of novelty, testability, and severity.\n- ConsistencyChecker and ExperimentDesigner rely on undefined methods (e.g., compare_predictions_observations, predictions_contradict, information_gain), preventing reproducibility.\n- Reported ‘distinguishing power’ values (0.90–0.95, page 6 and image on page 5) lack definitions, derivations, or uncertainty quantification.\n- Mischaracterization of Standard Model/GR predictions: claims of ‘no effect’ ignore EM-induced torques and GR’s coupling of EM energy to gravity (albeit negligible).\n- Experimental designs (Listings 5–6, page 5 and image on page 5) omit quantitative signal estimates, noise/confound modeling, shielding, controls, and power analyses.\n- Internal inconsistency: checklist claims complete and correct proofs (page 9, Q3=Yes) while Table 1 states mathematical consistency only medium and needing formalization.\n- No real datasets or statistical analyses are presented; cross-domain consistency uses unspecified data and a simple mean without uncertainty.\n- Algorithmic details (genetic optimization, feasibility ranking) are not specified; code is illustrative pseudocode, not executable or reproducible.\n- Budget and feasibility claims for precision gravimetry are unrealistic and unsubstantiated."

        "value": "This paper presents an AI-assisted framework for evaluating alternative scientific theories, using Zhang XiangQian's Unified Field Theory (UFT) as a test case. While the paper addresses an interesting problem regarding potential bias in evaluating unconventional theories, it has several significant issues that prevent acceptance.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe paper's core technical contribution is questionable. The AI framework described consists of relatively straightforward metrics (coverage scoring, parsimony ratios, consistency checking) that don't represent significant methodological advances. The mathematical formulations are simplistic, and the \"AI\" components appear to be basic algorithmic implementations rather than sophisticated machine learning approaches.\n\nMore critically, the paper's treatment of Zhang's UFT is problematic. The theory appears to make extraordinary claims (explaining dark matter, quantum entanglement, etc. through \"space moving at light speed\") but lacks rigorous mathematical foundation. The equations presented (e.g., equations 1-2) are poorly motivated and dimensionally questionable. The paper fails to demonstrate that UFT actually makes coherent, testable predictions beyond vague conceptual claims.\n\nClarity and Reproducibility:\nWhile the code listings provide implementation details, the theoretical foundation is unclear. The UFT equations are presented without proper derivation or physical justification. The claimed \"87.5% coverage\" of physics mysteries appears arbitrary, as the evaluation criteria are not rigorously defined.\n\nSignificance and Originality:\nThe paper's premise—using AI to evaluate alternative theories objectively—has merit, but the execution is flawed. The framework doesn't advance beyond basic comparative analysis tools. The choice of UFT as a test case undermines the work's credibility, as the theory appears to be fringe science without peer-reviewed foundation.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. The paper appears to advocate for a specific alternative theory (UFT) rather than presenting an objective evaluation framework\n2. The UFT claims are extraordinary but lack adequate theoretical foundation\n3. The \"AI\" components are basic algorithms, not sophisticated ML approaches\n4. No actual experimental validation is provided—only proposed experiments\n5. The paper conflates methodology development with theory advocacy\n\nEthical Considerations:\nWhile the paper claims to address bias, it itself appears biased toward promoting UFT. The framing suggests institutional physics is systematically biased against good alternative theories, but doesn't adequately consider that such theories might be rejected for valid scientific reasons.\n\nCitation Issues:\nThe references include unpublished work and non-peer-reviewed sources for the UFT theory, which undermines the scientific rigor.\n\nThe paper's fundamental flaw is conflating the development of evaluation methodology with advocacy for a specific alternative theory that lacks scientific foundation. A legitimate methodological contribution would test the framework on well-established competing theories rather than promoting fringe science."
