        "value": "This paper introduces 'simulated replications' as a methodological tool for social science, demonstrated through an AI-enabled survey pipeline attempting to replicate Hong et al. (2024) on race cues in mediated communication. The study uses a 2×2 design with a control (N=240; 200 analyzed), analyzes outcomes with two-way ANOVAs, and compares results qualitatively to the original. The main finding is a partial replication: the creator-race effect on credibility is reproduced and amplified, communicator-race effects disappear, and some outcomes are inflated compared to the human-sample study.\n\nStrengths include clear motivation, a coherent empirical narrative, and responsible framing of simulation as complementary to human-subject research. However, there is a major technical flaw: the reported ANOVA degrees of freedom are inconsistent with the design and sample sizes, suggesting either unreported exclusions or an analysis mismatch. The control group is not analyzed or justified. The analysis is based on a single run with no uncertainty quantification, and lacks reliability diagnostics, manipulation checks, or robustness checks.\n\nClarity is generally good, but key methodological details are missing (stimuli, randomization, prompts, model configuration). The empirical contribution is limited to a single case study, with no multi-study benchmarking or strong validation against human data. The idea is conceptually useful but incremental. Reproducibility is poor due to missing details and proprietary pipeline; code and data are not provided. Ethical considerations are addressed, but more detail on bias safeguards is needed. The paper is well-situated in the literature but could benefit from stronger methodological comparisons.\n\nActionable suggestions include fixing analytic inconsistencies, reporting full simulation details, quantifying simulation uncertainty, strengthening validation, clarifying constructs and manipulations, and discussing bias auditing.\n\nVerdict: The paper is well written and timely, but critical analytic inconsistencies, inadequate methodological detail, and limited evidential weight prevent acceptance at a high-standard venue. With substantial corrections and methodological strengthening, it could become publishable as a methodological demonstration. Overall recommendation: Reject."

        "value": "Simulation is increasingly recognized as a methodological complement to human-subjects research in the social sciences. This study demonstrates the potential and limitations of simulated data by replicating a published experiment on race cues in mediated communication. Using an AI-enabled workflow, we reproduced the design of Hong et al. [2024], which tested the effects of creator race and influencer race on evaluation, credibility, message acceptance, and engagement. A simulated panel of 240 participants was generated across four experimental conditions and a control group. Statistical analyses showed a partial replication: the main effect of creator race on credibility, a central finding in Hong et al.’s human-sample data, was reproduced and even amplified. Message acceptance again showed null effects. However, the effects of influencer race observed in Hong et al. [2024] were absent, while the effects on evaluation and participation were exaggerated. These results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of simulation: strong effects may be recoverable, but subtle, context-dependent differences may be lost. More broadly, simulation offers a pathway for accelerating theory testing, replication, and methodological innovation in social science research."

        "value": "This paper presents a compelling and timely investigation into the use of AI-driven simulations as a methodological tool for social science research. The authors conduct a simulated replication of a published study by Hong et al. (2024), examining the effects of creator race and virtual influencer race on audience perceptions. The simulation achieved a 'partial replication': it reproduced and amplified the main effect of creator race on credibility, exaggerated other effects (evaluation, engagement), and failed to capture subtle, context-dependent effects. The authors conclude that AI simulations are a promising complement—not a substitute—for human-subject research, best used for probing robust theories and triaging replication efforts.\n\nThe paper is highly significant, methodologically rigorous, and exceptionally well-written. It addresses a foundational question for the future of automated science and provides a balanced, nuanced discussion of the strengths and limitations of AI simulations. The originality lies in its direct, empirical comparison of AI simulations to a specific social science experiment, offering valuable insights into the boundary conditions of such methods.\n\nThe main weakness is reproducibility: the study relies on a proprietary platform ('Liner Research Agents'), and code/data are not yet released. The reviewer suggests releasing analysis scripts, synthetic/anonymized data, and detailed configuration prompts to improve reproducibility. Despite this, the paper's conceptual contribution and analysis quality make it a top-tier submission.\n\nOverall, this is a timely, rigorous, and significant contribution to AI-assisted science, with a clear recommendation for acceptance."

        "value": "This paper explores simulated replications as a methodological tool in social science research by attempting to replicate findings from Hong et al. [2024] on race cues in mediated communication using AI-generated participants. The study is technically sound, with appropriate statistical analyses (two-way ANOVAs, effect size comparisons) and a well-mirrored experimental design (N=240 simulated participants). The authors are transparent about both convergent and divergent findings, with partial replication of creator race effects and disappearance of influencer race effects. Statistical reporting is complete. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a systematic presentation of results and clear distinctions between types of replication. The work addresses an important methodological question and has practical implications, but its impact is limited by the single case study approach and reliance on a proprietary platform that limits reproducibility. The application of AI simulation is novel and creative, providing new insights, but reproducibility is hampered by the proprietary nature of the platform. The authors discuss limitations and ethics thoroughly, recommending hybrid approaches. Citations are appropriate, though the related work section could be more comprehensive. Major concerns include limited generalizability, reliance on proprietary tools, heavy AI involvement, and limited theoretical discussion of simulation effects. Minor issues include clarity of some statistical details and lack of discussion of specific AI models used."
