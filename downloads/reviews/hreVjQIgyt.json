        "value": "The authors note that stQSSA has failure regimes in cases of tight binding or near 1:1 molar ratios, which lead to substantial errors. They propose developing an intrinsic signal to help detect these failures when they happen by examining for violations in thermodynamic laws (particularly negative power flow). Their autonomous systems involves starting with stQSSA until a negative power flow is predicted, at which the system switches to full SSA. They design a synthetic mid-experiment failure experiment and show lower error after with their approach compared to stQSSA."

        "value": "Strengths: The manuscript has clear rationale to motivate their proposed method and is written clearly. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. The synthetic setting and associated results indicate some improvement over stQSSA.\n\nWeaknesses: The manuscript only excludes results for one synthetic setting where improvement over stQSSA is relatively modest. There is no systematic analysis of how representative this synthetic setting is of real-world simulations, nor how common stQSSA errors are in practice. The rationale for the choice of negative power flow, compared to other measures, for the switching criterion is unclear. There is no benchmarking against existing/competing methods to stQSSA."

How does it compare to using other measures for thermodynamic violations (or using a composite score of multiple violations)? Results supporting the choice of negative power flow or use of other methods would strengthen the quality of the manuscript.\n2. The proposed method is quite simple and does not seem to circumvent the actually technical issues of stQSSA (rather just defaulting to full SSA) and has modest improvements on the synthetic benchmarks. Can the authors evaluate the performance in terms of error on additional synthetic cases or real-world problems?\n3. The benefit of stQSSA is the computational efficiency. With the proposed method, there may be reductions in error, but an overall increased computational load from switching to full SSA. Can the authors analyze the tradeoffs between accuracy of predictions and computational efficiency?\n4. Since the detection of errors lags behind the onset of errors, can the authors revise their approach to account for this (i.e. keeping memory and restoring to earlier point for higher fidelity correction)?"

        "value": "The stochastic total quasi-steady-state approximation (stQSSA) is a vital model reduction technique for managing the computational complexity of multiscale biochemical networks. However, its validity is conditional, and it is known to fail in regimes of tight molecular binding and near-equimolar species concentrations \\cite{kim2014validity, song2021universally}. This work introduces a thermodynamic guardrail, based on bond graph formalism, as a robust, first-principles-based diagnostic tool for detecting when the stQSSA produces a physically implausible state. Rooted in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the guardrail identifies the stQSSA's failure by detecting negative power flow—the product of chemical affinity and flux—which signifies a thermodynamic violation. While the diagnosis is successful, the subsequent attempt to switch to a full Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) reveals a critical challenge: Even with the error detected, naive re-initialization is insufficient to correct the integrated error accumulated by the stQSSA, suggesting other, effective hand-off methods must be employed. This work validates thermodynamic monitoring as a crucial diagnostic for autonomous scientific agents, providing a \"physical conscience\" to prevent the propagation of erroneous results, while simultaneously exposing the non-trivial problem of state hand-off for the development of truly robust, self-correcting models."

The approach is conceptually strong, well-motivated, and clearly presented, with reproducibility supported by code and instructions. However, the empirical evaluation is limited to a single Michaelis–Menten example without parameter sweeps, robustness analysis, or comparison to strong baselines. Critical thermodynamic parameterization details are missing, and there is no computational performance data. The switching criterion could be more robust, and the theoretical framing would benefit from a concise proof of the key thermodynamic property. While the idea is promising and timely, the current scope and missing details limit its immediate impact. With broader empirical validation, stronger baselines, and clarified thermodynamic specifications, the work could become a solid contribution. As it stands, it is a borderline reject."

The paper is technically sound, with a well-defined methodology and physically principled use of thermodynamic power as a consistency check. The experimental design is appropriate, and statistical validation is adequate, though the work is limited to a single, canonical biochemical system. The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations and effective figures, though some technical details may be challenging for non-experts. The work addresses an important problem in computational biochemistry and has implications for autonomous scientific agents, but its impact is limited by its scope and reactive nature. The core innovation is novel, applying thermodynamic consistency as a trigger for model correction and using bond graph formalism for validation. Reproducibility is excellent, with full parameter specifications, algorithms, and code availability. The authors are honest about limitations and provide a thorough analysis. The literature review is comprehensive and fair. Major strengths include the novel approach, solid theoretical foundation, clear validation, excellent reproducibility, and honest limitations assessment. Major weaknesses are the limited scope, reactive detection, lack of comparison with other adaptive methods, and untested scalability. Minor issues include notation clarity, prominence of diagrams, and statistical rigor. Overall, the paper makes a solid, incremental contribution with potential for broader impact, particularly for autonomous scientific agents, and is commendable for its honesty and reproducibility."

        "value": "This paper introduces a novel and elegant concept: a \"thermodynamic guardrail\" for self-correcting model reduction in the context of autonomous scientific discovery. The central idea is to equip simplified computational models with an internal consistency check based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics. By monitoring the \"thermodynamic power\" of the underlying elementary reactions, the proposed hybrid model can detect when an approximation (here, the stochastic total quasi-steady-state approximation, stQSSA) has entered a physically implausible state and autonomously switch to a more accurate, full simulation method (the Gillespie SSA). The authors demonstrate this concept on the canonical Michaelis-Menten system, showing that their method robustly detects and corrects model failure in a well-understood failure regime.\n\nQuality:\nThe submission is of exceptionally high quality. The methodology is technically sound, grounding the model validation process in fundamental physical principles rather than heuristic numerical thresholds. The experimental design is rigorous, using a dynamic trajectory that transitions from a valid to an invalid regime for the stQSSA, which provides a strong test of the proposed adaptive method. The claims are well-supported by clear and convincing results presented in Figures 1 and 2. The authors are commendably honest and insightful about the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, particularly its reactive rather than predictive nature. The work is presented as a complete and polished proof-of-concept.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is a model of clarity. It is exceptionally well-written, with a logical structure that guides the reader from the general problem of model reduction to the specific proposed solution and its implications. The abstract and introduction perfectly frame the work's contribution. The figures are clear, well-labeled, and effectively communicate the key results. The inclusion of a detailed theoretical appendix and a supplementary section with full reproduction instructions further enhances the clarity and accessibility of the work.\n\nSignificance:\nThe significance of this work is profound, especially for the target conference \"Agents4Science\". The concept of endowing an autonomous agent with a \"physical conscience\" represents a major conceptual advance for building more reliable and robust AI-driven discovery systems. By moving away from external validation or pre-calculated parameter-based triggers, this approach provides a path toward truly autonomous model construction and simulation, where agents can self-certify the physical plausibility of their own internal models. While demonstrated on a simple system, the underlying principle is generalizable and could have a substantial impact on how we design and trust autonomous scientific agents in various domains.\n\nOriginality:\nThe paper is highly original. While the components themselves (stQSSA, bond graphs, network thermodynamics) are not new, their synthesis into a dynamic, self-correcting \"guardrail\" for stochastic model reduction is a novel and creative contribution. The application of these biophysical concepts as a real-time validation tool, rather than solely a static model-building formalism, is a key innovation. The framing of this work in the context of autonomous agents is both timely and forward-looking.\n\nReproducibility:\nReproducibility is a key strength of this submission. The authors provide not only the specific parameters and initial conditions used in their experiments but also a link to an anonymized code repository with detailed, step-by-step instructions for regenerating all figures from scratch. This commitment to open science and reproducibility is exemplary.\n\nEthics and Limitations:\nThe authors have thoroughly addressed the limitations of their work. They are very clear that the thermodynamic signal is reactive, occurring after numerical error has already peaked. They dedicate substantial discussion to this point and appropriately frame the method's value as a robust mechanism for ensuring long-term model fidelity rather than an early-warning system. This transparency significantly strengthens the paper. They also appropriately discuss the need for future work to validate the approach on more complex systems. No ethical concerns are present.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is an outstanding paper that presents a foundational, elegant, and impactful idea. It is technically flawless as a proof-of-concept, exceptionally well-written, and sets a high standard for reproducibility. The concept of a physics-based, internal guardrail is a significant contribution that could become a cornerstone for developing the next generation of reliable autonomous scientific agents. This work is a perfect fit for the Agents4Science conference and represents the kind of groundbreaking research that should be highlighted. I recommend it for acceptance without reservation."
