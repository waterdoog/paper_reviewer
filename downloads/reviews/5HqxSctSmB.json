        "value": "This paper presents a predictive model for grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV) using multi-temporal remote sensing data and spatial epidemiological approaches. However, it suffers from significant technical and methodological flaws. The methodology lacks mathematical rigor, and the multi-agent system is not validated against simpler approaches. The reported high F1-score (0.97) is likely an artifact of synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), raising concerns about overfitting and real-world applicability. The model relies heavily on historical disease counts, functioning more as a persistence forecast than a true predictive model, which limits its utility for early detection. Experimental design is unstable, with F1-scores ranging from 0.01 to 0.97, and class imbalance is inadequately addressed. There is a lack of proper cross-validation for spatial data, and comparisons between classification and regression are superficial. Reproducibility is limited due to unavailable data, and the automated machine learning process lacks transparency. The integration of remote sensing and spatial epidemiology is not novel, and the multi-agent system adds unnecessary complexity. Key biological factors are not incorporated, and the relationship between spectral features and infection is not established. While the paper is generally well-written, it contains overclaimed statements and does not adequately address its limitations. Overall, the work addresses an important problem but requires major revisions to address fundamental methodological issues, proper validation, and a more realistic assessment of the model's capabilities."

        "value": "This paper presents a multi-agent system that automates the scientific workflow for predicting Grapevine Red Blotch Virus (GRBV) incidence using multi-temporal remote sensing data and spatial epidemiological principles. The system iteratively engineers features and trains models, achieving a high F1-score of 0.97 after 20 iterations. The main contribution is the demonstration of an AI-driven research paradigm, with transparent discussion of challenges such as performance variability and reliance on historical data.\n\nThe work addresses a significant problem in viticulture and employs a technically sound approach, combining remote sensing, spatial statistics, and machine learning. Its most notable contribution is the novel multi-agent framework that automates nearly the entire research process, serving as a compelling case study for AI agents in scientific discovery. The authors' honest discussion of limitations, such as synthetic oversampling and the risk of the model being a \"persistence forecast,\" adds credibility.\n\nHowever, the scientific quality is limited by the narrative of the experimental process, which is presented as a sequence of trial-and-error iterations without a clear analysis of learning or adaptation between runs. The paper would be stronger with a detailed analysis of how the system adapted its strategy over the 20 experiments.\n\nThe originality is high, as the integration of known components into an autonomous multi-agent system is novel and aligns well with the conference theme. The paper is well-written and organized, but the methodology section lacks critical details about the agent system's architecture and operation, which is essential for the community to understand and build upon the work.\n\nReproducibility is the paper's main weakness. The dataset cannot be released due to privacy concerns, making the experimental claims unverifiable. The lack of detailed experimental logs also prevents reproduction of the discovery process. The authors are encouraged to provide exhaustive documentation of the 20 iterations, consider releasing a synthetic dataset, and add more detail about the agent system's implementation.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper is a fascinating and relevant exploration of AI-driven science, with major strengths in novelty and transparency but critical weaknesses in reproducibility and methodological detail. Despite the data sharing limitation, its value as a pioneering case study justifies acceptance, provided the authors improve methodological clarity and analysis of the experimental process."

        "value": "The paper addresses a timely and practically relevant problem at the intersection of plant epidemiology and remote sensing, proposing a multi-agent, AutoML-driven framework to predict 2024 grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV) incidence. The approach combines multi-temporal remote sensing features, spatial epidemiological features, and host factors, achieving a reported F1-score of 0.97. Strengths include the operational motivation, sensible use of spatio-temporal principles, iterative experimentation, and clear figures illustrating the workflow. However, there are major concerns: insufficient methodological specificity and reproducibility (missing algorithmic and data details, unclear cross-validation and oversampling procedures), potential label leakage and over-optimistic estimates (heavy reliance on prior-year counts, unclear spatial blocking), inconsistency between claims and actual features (hyperspectral vs. multispectral), narrow evaluation metrics for an imbalanced setting, clarity and completeness issues (incomplete citations, inconsistent iteration reporting), and limited scientific novelty (standard technical elements, conceptual multi-agent framing without empirical validation). Minor points include unclear spatial weighting, lack of phenological context, and insufficient reporting of feature importances and decision thresholds. Actionable suggestions are provided to strengthen the paper, including full data/model cards, robust evaluation design, baseline comparisons, leakage mitigation, and clarification of the agentic contribution. Overall, while the application is important and the results promising, the paper currently lacks the methodological rigor and clarity needed to support its claims. The recommendation is to reject at this stage, with encouragement to revise and resubmit after addressing the identified issues."

This study develops a predictive model for 2024 GRBV incidence using multi-temporal remote sensing and spatial epidemiological data collected prior to August 2024. We integrate hyperspectral imaging, spatial autocorrelation metrics, and host susceptibility factors within an automated machine learning framework. Our approach employs iterative feature engineering and addresses class imbalance, achieving a final F1-score of 0.97. Results demonstrate the critical importance of historical infection patterns, neighborhood effects, and vegetation health metrics, aligning with vector-mediated dispersal dynamics. The model highlights both the promise and limitations of remote sensing for pre-symptomatic detection, particularly its reliance on prior-year data. This work contributes an operational, data-driven framework for GRBV forecasting, with implications for precision viticulture and broader plant disease management. Future efforts should incorporate vector population dynamics and validate the approach across diverse environments."
