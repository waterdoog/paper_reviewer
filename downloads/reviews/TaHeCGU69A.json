        "value": "This paper presents a hybrid data-driven framework for predicting building energy retrofit performance, aiming to bridge the simulation-to-reality gap. The work is technically sound, with a well-motivated problem and a sensible combination of gradient boosting, physics-informed features, domain adaptation, and conformal prediction. The experimental design is solid, using building-disjoint splits and appropriate baselines. However, the final R² of 0.10 on real data, while an improvement over the baseline (-2.44), still indicates the model explains only 10% of the variance, raising concerns about practical utility. The real-world validation dataset is limited in scope and diversity, which may affect generalizability claims. Some methodological details, such as specific physics proxy calculations, could be clearer for full reproducibility. The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear motivation and adequate methodological description, though some sections could be more concise and detailed. The significance lies in addressing an important practical problem and providing a practical methodology, but the absolute performance leaves room for improvement. The originality comes from the combination of existing techniques for this specific Sim2Real problem, though none of the components are novel individually. The commitment to releasing code, data loaders, and configuration files is excellent for reproducibility. The authors are transparent about limitations and ethical considerations, and the literature review is appropriate, though the related work section could better position the contribution. Overall, the paper is a solid contribution with clear strengths in methodology, transparency, and reproducibility, but is limited by the scope of validation and modest performance gains."

        "value": "Predicting realized retrofit performance remains difficult due to a persistent simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap driven by construction and operational uncertainties, sensor biases, and occupant behavior. We propose a hybrid, data-driven framework that trains on large, standardized simulation corpora and calibrates on curated real-world monitoring datasets to quantify and reduce Sim2Real error. The approach augments tabular learners (e.g., XGBoost) with physics-informed features, applies domain-adaptive reweighting to correct distribution shift, and uses post-hoc conformal prediction for calibrated uncertainty. In-domain on iNSPiRe, the model attains $R^2=0.9075$ with $\\mathrm{MAE}=\\SI{0.027}{\\kWh\\per\\square\\metre\\per\\yr}$; cross-domain on real projects, a plain GBM collapses ($R^2=-2.44$), whereas our hybrid remains \\emph{viable} ($R^2=0.10$) and reduces MAE by $\\sim$54\\% (127.95 $\\rightarrow$ 58.25~\\si{\\kWh\\per\\month}). We contribute (i) a transparent Sim2Real evaluation protocol for retrofit prediction, (ii) a simple hybrid methodology that restores validity under shift, and (iii) reproducible assets (code, datasets, and experiment cards)."

The authors propose a multi-stage modeling stack, starting with a gradient boosting model trained on simulation data, enhanced with physics-informed features, domain-adaptive reweighting, and a final calibration step using real-world data. Uncertainty is quantified via conformal prediction. The framework significantly improves predictive validity (R² from -2.44 to 0.10), making it viable for real-world application.\n\nStrengths include the significance and impact of the problem addressed, technical rigor, exceptional experimental evaluation (including a strong ablation study), clarity and presentation, honest discussion of limitations, and a strong commitment to reproducibility. Weaknesses are minor: some confusion over metric scales in tables and a need for more detail on the real-world dataset.\n\nOverall, this is a high-quality, high-impact paper with rigorous evaluation and clear presentation. Its practical framework is a significant contribution, and I strongly recommend acceptance."

        "value": "The paper addresses an important and under-served problem—the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap in building energy retrofit prediction—by proposing a modular hybrid approach that combines physics-informed tabular models, domain-adaptive reweighting, post-hoc calibration, and conformal prediction intervals. The approach is positioned as transparent and simple, aligning with M&V practice, and demonstrates substantial improvement over a naive baseline (R2 improves from -2.44 to 0.10, with MAE and RMSE roughly halved). Strengths include the significance of the problem, pragmatic methodological choices, clear empirical contributions, and thoughtful uncertainty quantification and interpretability.\n\nHowever, the paper suffers from serious weaknesses that undermine its credibility and suitability for acceptance. There are major internal inconsistencies and presentation errors (contradictory table values, unresolved placeholders, unit errors), insufficient detail for reproducibility (inadequate dataset description, missing implementation details, lack of code/data links), and modest absolute performance on real projects (R2 = 0.10 is low, with no actionable M&V metrics reported). The main results table omits key baselines, and alternative domain adaptation methods are not evaluated. The error decomposition is not quantitatively realized, and conditional biases are not addressed beyond future work.\n\nWhile the framework is conceptually sound and the problem is important, the current manuscript is marred by inconsistencies, missing details, and limited baselines. The clarity and reproducibility are inadequate, and the absolute performance remains weak. The paper is not suitable for acceptance in its current form, but with corrections, stronger baselines, and clearer, consistent reporting, it could become a solid contribution to Sim2Real modeling for building retrofits."
