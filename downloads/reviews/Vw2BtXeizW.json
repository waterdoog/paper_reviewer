        "value": "This paper presents a framework for self-aware AI review bias detection, evaluated across four language models on a small set of scientific papers. While the paper addresses a significant and timely problem and is exceptionally well-written and structured, it suffers from critical methodological and evaluative flaws. The technical quality is low, relying on simplistic pattern-matching for bias detection, which is unlikely to capture the complexity of cognitive biases. The evaluation is fundamentally flawed: the primary metric is circular, and key metrics lack defined ground truth, making reported accuracy figures unsubstantiated. There is a fatal contradiction between reported results and the author checklist, casting doubt on the validity of the findings. Although the problem is significant and the framing original, the technical contribution is minimal. Reproducibility is hindered by missing details and unclear ground truth definitions. Despite high clarity and professional presentation, the paper's methodological flaws and contradictions make it unsuitable for acceptance. The work serves more as a case study in AI-generated scientific writing than a substantive contribution to bias detection. Rejection is recommended."

        "value": "The paper addresses an important and timely problem—bias detection and mitigation in AI-generated scientific peer reviews—using a self-aware, real-time correction framework. It evaluates five bias types across multiple models (GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-4, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) and reports significant reductions in bias, with results illustrated in several figures and tables. Strengths include the high-impact application, multi-model comparison, inclusion of negative findings, clear structure, and some statistical framing. The discussion offers interesting hypotheses about training paradigms and self-correction.\n\nHowever, there are major concerns:\n1. The construct validity of the bias measures is weak, relying on simplistic dictionary-based pattern matching that risks conflating ordinary language with bias and lacks proper validation.\n2. The evaluation is undermined by missing or unclear ground truth, making metrics like self-detection accuracy and confidence calibration uninterpretable.\n3. Statistical claims are implausibly strong given the small sample size and lack of transparency about tests and assumptions.\n4. Reproducibility is compromised by missing implementation details, unavailable code/data, and lack of prompt and dictionary inventories.\n5. Design limitations, such as using only landmark AI papers and post-hoc rather than real-time correction, compromise the validity of claims about domain familiarity and real-time mitigation.\n6. There are editorial and internal consistency issues.\n\nWhile the problem is significant and the framing has potential, the novelty is limited by basic methods, and the empirical findings lack significance due to unvalidated measures and weak experimental design. The paper discusses limitations and ethics, but methodological weaknesses undermine the reliability of reported bias reductions.\n\nActionable recommendations include establishing construct validity with controlled experiments and annotated data, rigorously defining and measuring confidence calibration, clarifying statistical analysis, improving reproducibility, implementing true real-time mitigation, and broadening the evaluation to diverse domains and stronger baselines.\n\nVerdict: Despite addressing an important problem and providing an interesting negative result for one model, the paper's measurement validity, statistical credibility, and reproducibility are insufficient for acceptance at a high-standard venue. The claims rely on unvalidated proxies and unclear ground truths, making the reported improvements difficult to interpret or trust."

        "value": "This paper presents a study on 'Self-Aware AI Review Bias Detection,' aiming for real-time bias identification in AI-generated scientific reviews. While the topic is relevant, the paper suffers from significant flaws. The sample size is extremely small (n=6 per model), undermining statistical power and generalizability. The bias detection method is simplistic, relying on pattern matching without validation against human judgment, and the scoring formula lacks theoretical justification. The experimental design lacks proper controls and baseline comparisons, and the negative results for some models suggest the framework is not robust. Key experimental details are missing, making reproduction impossible. The statistical analysis is questionable due to the small sample size, and the claimed effect sizes may be artifacts. The approach is too simplistic to address complex biases in scientific review, and the novelty is limited. Major concerns include the small sample size, lack of validation, inconsistent results, and missing implementation details. The authors acknowledge some limitations but underestimate their severity. Overall, the work is preliminary and requires substantial improvement before it can contribute meaningfully to the field."

        "value": "As AI systems increasingly participate in scientific peer review, understanding and mitigating their inherent biases becomes critical for maintaining research integrity. We present the first systematic investigation of self-aware bias detection in AI-generated scientific reviews, where AI reviewers identify and correct their own biases in real-time during review generation. Our framework analyzes five key bias types: position bias, length bias, negativity bias, self-enhancement bias, and domain familiarity bias. Through controlled experiments across four state-of-the-art language models (GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-4, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) on 6 scientific papers per model, we demonstrate significant bias reduction with Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 36.2\\% bias reduction (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 3.62) and 85.6\\% confidence improvement. Our statistical analysis with Bonferroni correction confirms robust results across all models with large effect sizes (d > 1.77). This work establishes the first quantitative framework for AI reviewer self-awareness and provides a foundation for developing more reliable AI-assisted peer review systems."
