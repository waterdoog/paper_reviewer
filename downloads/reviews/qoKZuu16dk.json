        "value": "This paper investigates whether machine learning can detect cardiac remodeling signatures in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) patterns from patients with varying atrial fibrillation (AF) burden levels using continuous 72-hour ECG monitoring. The study is technically sound, with appropriate methodology, including the use of the S-Patch device and the LGBM algorithm. Feature extraction is comprehensive, and results show a threshold effect at 70% AF burden, with excellent discrimination (AUC=0.9858) for the extreme AF burden group, though performance is poor in low AF burden groups (AUC=0.4651 for 10-20% burden). The paper is well-written and organized, with clear methodology and effective use of figures and tables. The restriction to nighttime periods and heart rates <70 bpm is well-explained. The work addresses an important clinical question and has potential clinical implications, though immediate impact is limited by the retrospective, single-center design and need for prospective validation. The approach is original, being the first large-scale study using continuous 72-hour wearable ECG monitoring with machine learning for this purpose. Methods are detailed, but some computational details and statistical significance testing are missing. Limitations are adequately addressed, and ethical guidelines are followed. The paper cites relevant literature and situates itself well in the context of existing work. Concerns include possible confounding in the control group, small sample sizes in higher AF burden categories, lack of clinical outcome data, limited generalizability, and missing statistical significance testing. Strengths include a large sample size, rigorous methodology, clear demonstration of AF burden-dependent effects, honest discussion of limitations, and clinically relevant findings. The transparency regarding AI involvement in manuscript preparation is also noted."

        "value": "Abstract\n\nExploring cardiac remodeling through atrial fibrillation burden monitoring using a 72-hour wearable ECG device and machine learning methods\n\nBackground: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia globally, affecting over 33 million individuals and significantly increasing risks of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. Understanding cardiac remodeling—encompassing structural and functional heart changes—is crucial for AF management.\n\nObjective: This study investigates whether machine learning algorithms can detect differences in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) between individuals with varying AF burden levels, hypothesizing that such differences may indicate underlying structural cardiac changes.\n\nMethods: We analyzed data from 1,673 patients at Wonju Severance Hospital, South Korea, using S-Patch wearable ECG devices for continuous 72-hour monitoring. Patients were stratified into six groups based on AF burden: control (0%, n=1,281), low (10-20%, n=43), moderate (20-40%, n=49), high (40-70%, n=29), very high (70-90%, n=13), and extreme (90-99%, n=44). ECG segments with heart rates <70 bpm collected during nighttime (0:00-6:00) were divided into one-minute intervals and subsequently into 10-second segments for analysis. The Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) algorithm was employed for binary classification tasks using 82 features extracted from lead II P-QRS-T waves, statistical measurements, and demographic data.\n\nResults: Model performance varied significantly across AF burden groups, with meaningful discrimination observed from AF burden levels ≥70%. The extreme group (90-99%) achieved the highest performance with AUC = 0.9858, sensitivity = 93.69%, and specificity = 94.96%, while the low AF burden group (10-20%) exhibited poor discrimination (AUC = 0.4651). P-wave characteristics and heart rate variability parameters emerged as the most discriminative features, suggesting that atrial electrical remodeling and autonomic nervous system changes are key distinguishing markers.\n\nConclusions: These findings highlight a clear threshold effect at 70% AF burden, supporting the hypothesis of significant cardiac remodeling associated with higher AF burden levels. The superior discrimination in patients with extreme AF burden indicates substantial structural and electrical changes that fundamentally alter NSR characteristics. This work demonstrates the potential for NSR-based analysis to serve as a non-invasive biomarker of cardiac remodeling, with applications in risk stratification, treatment response monitoring, and personalized therapeutic approaches in AF management."

        "value": "This paper addresses an important clinical question—detecting atrial remodeling signatures in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) ECGs as a function of atrial fibrillation (AF) burden using machine learning on wearable device data. The study leverages a large dataset (n=1,673) and applies thoughtful preprocessing and feature engineering, with clear trends in results and plausible physiological correlates identified. However, there are several major methodological flaws that undermine the credibility of the findings:\n\n1. The most critical issue is the high risk of data leakage due to segment-level rather than patient-level splitting, which could fully explain the reported near-perfect AUCs (up to 0.986 in high-burden groups). Without strict patient-level partitioning, performance metrics are likely inflated and not clinically meaningful.\n2. The evaluation is performed at the segment level, not the patient level, which limits clinical interpretability and practical utility.\n3. Key confounders (medications, comorbidities) are not controlled, and demographic differences between groups may drive the observed signal rather than true remodeling.\n4. Small sample sizes in high-burden strata (n=13 and n=44) make the results unstable and prone to optimistic bias, especially in the presence of leakage. Confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates are missing.\n5. Methodological details are incomplete, including feature definitions, preprocessing steps, model hyperparameters, and class weighting strategies, limiting reproducibility.\n6. The paper overinterprets causality from cross-sectional, observational data, without sufficiently addressing alternative explanations for the observed associations.\n\nWhile the manuscript is readable and the pipeline is clearly depicted, the lack of critical implementation details and the omission of key groups from figures (e.g., low-burden ROC) further detract from clarity and transparency. The work is original in its use of long-term, single-lead wearable data and burden-stratified analysis, but it does not sufficiently situate itself relative to prior literature.\n\nReproducibility is limited by the absence of data, code, and methodological transparency. Ethical considerations are addressed, but the most critical limitation (patient-level leakage) is not explicitly discussed. Citations are generally appropriate but miss seminal work in the field.\n\nActionable recommendations include re-running analyses with strict patient-level splits, reporting patient-level metrics and uncertainty, controlling for confounders, providing complete methodological details, and conducting external validation. Minor comments address figure completeness, accuracy of statements, and clarification of feature usage and sampling.\n\nOverall, while the problem is important and the design is thoughtful, the current evaluation has critical flaws that undermine the central claims. Without rigorous patient-level evaluation and stronger methodological controls, the results are not credible. I recommend rejection in the current form."
