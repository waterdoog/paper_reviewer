        "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar\n     concepts within their training data's \"gravity wells.\" While advanced search-based methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to \n     mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to guide \n     exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Magellan}, a novel framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, \n     guided exploration of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a \n     hierarchical guidance system. For long-range direction, a \"semantic compass\" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection, steers the \n     search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions, a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with\n     an explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty, and narrative progress. Extensive experiments \n     demonstrate that Magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in generating scientific ideas with \n     superior plausibility and innovation. Our work shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more effective than \n     unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more capable partners in innovation."

        "value": "This paper introduces Magellan, a novel framework for generating innovative ideas with Large Language Models (LLMs) by reframing the task as a guided exploration of the model's latent conceptual space. The authors identify a key weakness in existing methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT)—their reliance on unprincipled and inconsistent LLM self-evaluation. To address this, Magellan employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a sophisticated, hierarchical system. This system consists of a long-range \"semantic compass\" to provide a global direction towards novelty (formulated via orthogonal projection of concept embeddings) and a local, principled, multi-objective value function that balances coherence, novelty, and narrative progress. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that Magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ToT and ReAct, as well as specialized AI-for-Science frameworks, in generating plausible and innovative scientific ideas.\n\nStrengths:\n- High significance and impact: Tackles a crucial problem at the forefront of AI research, moving LLMs from generating plausible text to genuinely novel ideas, with impactful applications to scientific discovery. The insight that principled, guided search is more effective than unconstrained \"agency\" is significant.\n- Exceptional originality and technical quality: The method is highly original and technically sound, combining MCTS with a hierarchical guidance system. The \"semantic compass\" and the multi-objective value function are particularly novel and well-motivated. Integration into the MCTS framework is clean and effective.\n- Extremely thorough and convincing evaluation: The experimental validation is exemplary, with strong baselines, clear and decisive results (92% win rate against general baselines, 90% against specialized frameworks), insightful ablation studies, and further analyses on efficiency and scaling.\n- Exceptional clarity and reproducibility: The paper is well-written, clear, and detailed, with a strong commitment to reproducibility.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The primary weakness is the reliance on an LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation, which is less reliable than human expert evaluation. However, this is mitigated by using a strong judge model and a structured evaluation prompt. This minor weakness does not detract from the overall strength of the paper.\n\nOverall Recommendation:\nThis is an outstanding paper that sets a new state-of-the-art for creative idea generation with LLMs. It is technically innovative, rigorously evaluated, and clearly presented. The work provides a powerful new method and significant conceptual insight, making it a landmark contribution to AI for Science and agentic AI. I recommend it for acceptance without hesitation."

        "value": "This paper introduces Magellan, a framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to guide Large Language Model (LLM) generation for scientific idea creation. The approach combines a \"semantic compass\" for long-range direction with a multi-objective value function for local decisions. The paper is technically sound with a well-designed methodology, addressing limitations in existing approaches like Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The experimental design is comprehensive, with strong baselines and effective ablation studies. However, evaluation relies entirely on LLM-as-a-Judge, which may not fully capture scientific novelty. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides sufficient mathematical detail. The work is significant, demonstrating a 92% win rate over baselines, though its impact is limited by focus on idea generation and evaluation on a single model family. The combination of MCTS with semantic guidance is novel, and the hierarchical guidance system is a meaningful advance. The authors commit to releasing code and data, though some implementation details are deferred to supplementary materials. Limitations and ethical considerations are appropriately acknowledged. The related work section is comprehensive. Specific concerns include reliance on LLM-as-a-Judge, experiments limited to one model family, need for more theoretical justification of the semantic compass, and some deferred implementation details. Strengths include a novel approach, strong results, clear identification of limitations in existing methods, and well-motivated contributions. Overall, the paper presents a solid technical contribution with strong empirical results and clear innovations, despite some limitations in evaluation and scope."

Strengths include conceptual clarity, methodological coherence, reproducibility efforts, and responsible AI discussion. However, the review identifies major weaknesses: (1) severe inconsistencies in reported results (contradictory win rates, compute times, missing/undefined parameters), (2) evaluation design issues (sole reliance on a single LLM judge, implausibly poor baselines, potential evaluation bias, lack of external benchmarks), (3) under-specified methodological details (embedding/scoring specifics, hyperparameter sensitivity, search mechanics, generalization), (4) lack of statistical rigor (no significance tests or judge agreement), and (5) clarity/polish issues (contradictions, missing references). While the core idea is original and potentially significant, these issues undermine confidence in the results and reproducibility. The review recommends rejection, but notes that with resolved inconsistencies, stronger baselines, robust evaluation, and clearer methodology, the work could become a compelling contribution."

A mathematically coherent but scientifically implausible idea would score well. This undermines claims about generating \"plausible\" research.\n- The paper tests only on the Qwen model family, severely limiting generalizability claims. Different architectural families may respond differently to MCTS-based guidance.\n- The computational cost is 5x higher than Tree of Thoughts (5548s vs 3563s) for modest quality improvements. The paper doesn't explore whether intermediate cost/quality tradeoffs exist or whether the efficiency could be improved while maintaining gains.\n- Evaluation via LLM-as-a-Judge is a significant limitation that's acknowledged but not adequately addressed. There's no human expert validation, which is important for assessing whether generated ideas are actually scientifically valuable versus just sounding impressive.\n- The GitHub URL field is empty in your reproducibility statement"
