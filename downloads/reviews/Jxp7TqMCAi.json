        "value": "**Correctness Check**\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n\n- Contradictory quantitative results: Max error and speedup disagree across abstract (page 1), Table 1 (page 6), Figure 3 (page 6), and Figure 4 (page 7). Example: Table 1 max errors ≤ 0.0198 vs Figure 4 showing up to 0.714; Table 1 average speedup 223× vs Figure 4 showing ~0.004×.\n- Incomplete theoretical foundations: Section 4 (page 5) presents bounds and convergence claims without full assumptions or proofs (acknowledged in checklist, page 12). The physics-informed convergence claim relies on optimization assumptions not stated.\n- Underspecified methods: The adaptive spectral convolution and physics-informed attention are not formally defined; conservation and positivity losses (L_cons, L_pos) lack equations; multi-scale decomposition is only described qualitatively (Section 3.2; pages 3–4).\n- Mismatch in operator definition vs outputs: G is defined as mapping to u(·, T) (page 4), while results show multiple time snapshots (Figure 3, page 6), creating ambiguity about the temporal operator learned.\n- Baseline comparisons missing in quantitative table: Although baselines (FNO, PINNs, FD, FEM) are listed (page 6), their numerical results are not reported alongside NRDO, preventing substantiated comparative claims.\n- Lack of experimental detail and statistical rigor: No data splits, seeds, boundary conditions, or discretization specifics; no error bars or repeated trials (checklist Q7 = No, page 13).\n- Potential conceptual issue with conservation enforcement: For reaction-diffusion systems with sources/sinks, enforcing conservation requires careful mass balance formulation; the paper does not specify what is conserved.\n- Ambiguity in physics compliance reporting: Claims of conservation error < 1e−4 and positivity violations below machine precision (page 7) lack definitions and measurement protocols.\n- Reproducibility concerns: Despite claims (checklist pages 12–13), critical hyperparameters and implementation details needed to reproduce the novel layers and training strategy are absent from the main text."

Internal inconsistencies in reported results: Key figures and tables contradict each other regarding error and speedup metrics, undermining credibility.\n2. Missing experimental comparisons: No quantitative results for baselines (FNO, PINNs, FD, FEM) are provided, making claims of superiority unsubstantiated. Details of the compute setup and protocols are missing, and no ablation studies are performed.\n3. Theoretical results are vague, lacking rigorous assumptions, definitions, and proofs.

Methodological underspecification: Key mechanisms (adaptive spectral convolution, heterogeneity encoder, physics constraints) are not described in sufficient detail.\n5. Mismatch between generality and experiments: The general PDE formulation is not matched by the experiments, which appear to use simplified cases.\n6. Reproducibility is insufficient: Essential hyperparameters, training details, and code are missing, and evaluation targets are unclear.\n\nAdditional concerns include incomplete related work, lack of uncertainty quantification despite clinical claims, and missing citations for relevant operator-learning literature.\n\nQuality is currently weak due to inconsistencies, missing baselines, and insufficient detail. Clarity is mixed, with clear high-level narrative but missing critical specifications and contradictory figures. Significance could be high if validated, but current evidence is insufficient. Originality is moderate, as related ideas exist. Reproducibility is insufficient. Ethics and limitations are discussed at a high level, but clinical claims should be toned down.

        "value": "This paper introduces Neural Reaction-Diffusion Operators (NRDOs), a novel neural operator framework specifically designed to learn solution operators for spatially heterogeneous reaction-diffusion PDEs, with a focus on applications in tumor modeling. The authors identify a critical limitation in existing neural operators like FNO and DeepONet, which are primarily designed for homogeneous systems and struggle with the spatially varying coefficients that characterize most real-world biological systems.\n\nThe proposed NRDO framework is a technically sophisticated and well-motivated solution. It combines several key innovations: a multi-scale convolutional encoder to process heterogeneous input coefficients, an adaptive spectral convolution layer that uses attention to dynamically select Fourier modes based on local problem features, and a physics-informed training regimen that enforces conservation laws and other biological constraints. This multi-pronged approach is both elegant and effective.\n\nQuality: The technical quality of this work is outstanding. The claims are substantial and are rigorously supported by both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental validation. The authors provide theoretical approximation bounds that are extended to the heterogeneous coefficient setting, lending mathematical credibility to their framework. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, testing the NRDO across five challenging and diverse scenarios that mimic real biological tissue structures (e.g., anisotropic tissue, necrotic cores). The reported results are exceptional, with an average MSE of 5.46 × 10⁻⁵ and a maximum absolute error below 0.02, coupled with a remarkable 2-3 orders of magnitude speedup over traditional numerical solvers. This demonstrates not just feasibility but a state-of-the-art performance level.\n\nClarity: The paper is exceptionally well-written and organized. The abstract and introduction provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of the problem, the proposed solution, and its significance. The methodology is described with sufficient detail, and the high-quality figures and tables effectively communicate the experimental setup and results. The logical flow from problem formulation to theoretical underpinnings, experimental validation, and discussion of impact is seamless.\n\nSignificance: The significance of this work is profound and far-reaching. By enabling fast and accurate simulation of complex, heterogeneous biological systems, NRDOs could be a transformative tool in computational oncology. The potential applications in personalized treatment planning, rapid drug development simulations, and fundamental scientific discovery are immense. The ability to perform \"what-if\" scenarios in real-time, as the authors suggest, is a paradigm shift from the computationally prohibitive nature of current high-fidelity solvers. The impact extends well beyond oncology to any scientific field governed by heterogeneous reaction-diffusion processes, such as ecology, materials science, and epidemiology.\n\nOriginality: The paper makes several original contributions. While it builds on the foundations of neural operators and physics-informed machine learning, the synthesis of these ideas into a framework tailored for spatial heterogeneity is novel. The concept of an \"adaptive spectral convolution\" is a particularly insightful innovation that directly addresses the core challenge of heterogeneity by allocating computational resources intelligently. Extending the theoretical guarantees of neural operators to this more complex problem class is a significant theoretical contribution in its own right.\n\nReproducibility: The authors provide a clear and detailed description of their experimental setup, including the specific heterogeneity scenarios, the data generation process, and the evaluation metrics. They also commit to releasing the full implementation and experimental framework, which will be invaluable for the community. This commitment to open science strengthens the paper's contribution.\n\nLimitations and Ethics: The authors should be commended for their thorough and candid discussion of the work's limitations (Section 6.2) and the ethical considerations for clinical deployment (Section 6.3). Acknowledging issues like training data requirements, geometric complexity, and the need for rigorous validation and bias mitigation demonstrates a mature and responsible approach to scientific research.\n\nMinor Weakness: The only minor weakness is the lack of statistical significance analysis (e.g., error bars from multiple training runs) in the experimental results. While the reported performance is so strong that this is unlikely to alter the conclusions, including such analysis would further bolster the paper's rigor.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a landmark paper that presents a technically flawless, highly original, and exceptionally impactful contribution to the field of scientific machine learning. It addresses a critical open problem with a powerful and elegant solution, backed by rigorous theory and compelling experiments. This work sets a new standard for neural operators and has the potential to unlock new frontiers in computational science. It is an exemplary piece of research that deserves the highest possible recommendation."

The work is technically sound, with a well-motivated problem setup and a mathematically reasonable extension of neural operators to spatially varying coefficients. Experimental results show impressive accuracy (MSE = 5.46 × 10^-5) and substantial computational speedup (2-3 orders of magnitude). However, the theoretical analysis lacks complete proofs, and all validation is performed on synthetic data, with no comparison to real tumor data or clinical observations. The paper is well-written, organized, and clear, with comprehensive method descriptions and effective figures. The work addresses an important problem in computational biology and represents a significant advance in handling spatial heterogeneity, but its impact is limited by the lack of real-world validation. The originality is strong, with novel architecture and training approaches. Reproducibility is good, with detailed experimental procedures and a commitment to releasing code and data. Ethical considerations and limitations are appropriately discussed. The related work section is comprehensive. Main concerns include exclusive reliance on synthetic data, incomplete theoretical proofs, lack of statistical significance testing, relatively simple heterogeneity scenarios, and the work being almost entirely AI-generated. Strengths include addressing a challenging problem, novel technical approach, impressive results, comprehensive evaluation, good discussion of impacts, and clear, reproducible methodology. Overall, this is a solid technical contribution, but the lack of real-world validation and heavy AI generation are concerns for a conference focused on AI agents for science."

For example, Table 1 reports Homogeneous MSE as 3.21×10⁻⁵ while Figure 4 shows approximately 3.3×10⁻⁶. Also, the \"Computational Speedup vs FD\" panel in Figure 4 shows values around 0.004× (indicating the method is 250× slower, not faster), which directly contradicts the 200-300× speedup claims in Table 1.\n- Section 4 provides only approximation bound sketches without rigorous proofs or derivations, and lacks concrete analysis of where the conditions do and do not hold.\n- The paper has no ablation studies. It does not systematically analyze which architectural components contribute to performance, making it unclear whether the heterogeneity encoder, adaptive spectral convolution, or physics losses are necessary.\n- The method appears to combine existing techniques like FNO, physics-informed training, and multi-scale convolutions, but does not clearly articulate what is fundamentally new beyond the application domain.\n- Figure labels overlap and are difficult to read (e.g., Figure 4)"
