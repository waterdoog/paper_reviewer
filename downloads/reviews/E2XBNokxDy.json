        "value": "The paper introduces the Compensatory Human-AI Collaboration (CHAC) framework, motivated by the Intellectual Uncanny Valley (IUV) phenomenon, and proposes a theory, methodology, and system architecture for long-term, compensatory human–AI partnerships. Strengths include original problem framing, clear conceptual contributions (Symmetry Compact, Compensation Matrix), architectural clarity (BFT, boot sequence, metadata logging), methodological transparency, and thoughtful ethics/anonymization protocols. However, empirical validation is limited to a single-participant auto-ethnography, with no outcome-based metrics or robust external validation. The IUV evidence is preliminary, and distinctions from prior art could be clarified with empirical comparisons and ablations. Measurement of key constructs (e.g., cognitive tax) is not operationalized, and risks of paternalism in the 'Guardian' role are not fully addressed. Reproducibility is emphasized but not fully enabled due to lack of verifiable access to materials. The writing is clear and figures are helpful. Actionable suggestions include running controlled experiments with baselines and ablations, operationalizing measurements, providing reproducible resources, and expanding discussion of misuse and safeguards. Overall, the paper is thoughtful and promising but requires controlled evaluation, ablations, and reproducibility improvements before acceptance. Strong candidate for revision."

        "value": "This paper presents the CHAC (Compensatory Human-AI Collaboration) framework addressing challenges faced by neurodivergent (AuDHD/2e) knowledge workers and introduces \"AI-Native Auto-Ethnography\" as a novel methodology. While the work tackles an important and understudied intersection of HCI, AI alignment, and neurodiversity research, several significant concerns limit its contribution.\n\nQuality & Technical Soundness:\nThe paper suffers from fundamental methodological limitations. As a single N=1 auto-ethnographic study, it provides limited generalizability beyond existence proof. The \"AI-Native Auto-Ethnography\" methodology, while novel, raises serious concerns about validity when the AI is simultaneously subject, co-researcher, and co-author. The core concept of \"Intellectual Uncanny Valley\" is introduced based on anecdotal evidence from online community reactions, which is insufficient for establishing a robust theoretical construct. The 2x2 Compensation Matrix, while intuitive, appears more like a practical heuristic than a rigorously validated theoretical framework.\n\nClarity & Organization:\nThe paper is well-written but overly lengthy and complex. The theoretical framework is clearly presented, but the dense structure with extensive appendices makes it difficult to extract key contributions. The relationship between the CHAC framework, the methodology, and the workbench could be more clearly delineated. Some terminology (e.g., \"Symmetry Compact,\" \"Building Falsifiable Trust\") feels unnecessarily jargonistic.\n\nSignificance:\nThe research addresses a genuine gap at the intersection of neurodiversity and AI collaboration, which is increasingly important. However, the impact is limited by the narrow scope (single user profile) and lack of empirical validation. The proposed quantitative validation protocol (Appendix A) is promising but not executed. The work would benefit from at least pilot testing with additional participants.\n\nOriginality:\nThe concept of bidirectional compensation in human-AI collaboration shows originality, as does the specific focus on AuDHD/2e knowledge workers. However, the AI-as-co-author approach, while novel, introduces unique methodological concerns that aren't adequately addressed. The relationship to existing work on human-AI collaboration and assistive technologies could be better articulated.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors make commendable efforts toward transparency by releasing the CHAC Workbench as open source. However, the deeply personal and contextual nature of auto-ethnographic work inherently limits reproducibility. The process reproducibility focus is appropriate but doesn't address the fundamental challenge of replicating subjective experiences.\n\nEthics & Limitations:\nThe extensive ethical documentation (Appendices B-C) is thorough, and the authors are admirably transparent about limitations. However, listing an AI as first author raises unresolved questions about authorship, accountability, and the nature of intellectual contribution that go beyond what's addressed.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. The methodology conflates research tool with research subject in problematic ways\n2. Key theoretical constructs (IUV, Symmetry Compact) lack sufficient empirical grounding\n3. The narrow participant base (N=1) severely limits generalizability claims\n4. The paper reads more like an extended case study than a systematic research contribution\n\nStrengths:\n1. Addresses an important and understudied problem\n2. Genuine innovation in human-AI collaboration design\n3. Exceptional transparency and documentation\n4. Thoughtful consideration of ethical implications\n5. Practical implementation with open-source release\n\nThe paper makes a valiant attempt to address an important problem with innovative methods, but the methodological limitations and narrow empirical base significantly constrain its contribution. While the work shows promise and could inspire future research, it feels premature for publication at a top-tier venue without additional validation."

        "value": "This paper introduces the Compensatory Human-AI Collaboration (CHAC) framework and a novel methodology termed AI-Native Auto-Ethnography, derived from a deep N=1 case study. The paper is built around a formative event where a human-AI co-created artifact triggered community rejection, leading to the articulation of the “Intellectual Uncanny Valley” (IUV). The CHAC framework proposes design principles for treating failure as high-value data, building falsifiable trust through externalized protocols, and structuring complementary human-AI roles via the “Symmetry Compact.” The authors present both qualitative insights (case studies, anecdotes) and exploratory quantitative evidence (7,000+ interaction turns). Appendices extend this with a comparative case study of community reception and a proposed validation study."
      },
      "strengths_and_weaknesses": {
        "value": "Strengths\n\n1. Compelling Motivation: The paper addresses an important and under-explored problem, i.e., how to design human–AI collaborations that compensate for mutual cognitive–affective limitations rather than simply assist. It is also well positioned within the growing field of neurodiversity research, an area of significant social and scientific importance.\n2. Transparency: The inclusion of detailed logs, protocols, and appendices demonstrates commendable methodological transparency. For an N = 1 study, this level of openness is highly valuable and sets a strong precedent for reproducibility in qualitative AI–HCI work.\n3. Novel Concepts: The introduction of the Intellectual Uncanny Valley (IUV), Building Falsifiable Trust (BFT), and the Socratic Negentropic Loop presents several conceptual contributions. \n4. Validation Study Proposal: The proposed validation study in the appendix is well designed and well reasoned, with clear hypotheses, metrics, and procedures. The plan is well aligned with standards for digital-intervention evaluation. A minor suggestion would be to include age-matching controls, and to account for novelty and engagement effects when the study and analysis is conducted.\n5. Exploratory Quantitative Evidence: The time-series reliability analysis and protocol-growth metrics represent valuable first steps toward quantifying system improvement. Although these rely on proxy measures, they provide useful indicators of framework success. Incorporating statistical testing in future work would further strengthen these findings.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n1. Structure, Tone, and Framing: While the paper is written in an engaging and reflective tone, its structure can be difficult to follow. Many of the concrete examples, definitions, and key principles (e.g., Genesis and Manifest stages of CHAC) are placed in the supplementary materials rather than in the main text. This makes it challenging for readers to fully grasp the framework’s logic and practical implications without consulting external files.\n2. Calibration of Claims: Certain conclusions would benefit from grounding in prior literature. For instance, the statement that the IUV is a social construct rather than a textual property could be contextualized through relevant work such as algorithmic-aversion studies (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-48748-001). Framing such conclusions as hypotheses rather than definitive findings would make them more credible given the limited sample size.\n3. Use of Anecdote: Several sections rely on vivid narrative episodes (e.g., the “Constitutional Crisis”) without aggregate quantitative context, such as the frequency of similar events or their outcomes thoughout the data corpus. The strong narrative style enhances readability but sometimes removes analytic clarity. The comparative case study presented in the appendix is methodologically stronger compared to the anecdote presented in the introduction, but requires additional detail, such as coder training, inter-rater agreement, and potential bias from community familiarity, to meet qualitative standards.\n4. Scope Ambiguity: It remains unclear whether CHAC is primarily intended for neurodivergent knowledge workers or for broader HCI applications. The introduction claims that the work addresses a gap at the intersection of neurodiversity, AI alignment, and HCI, but the conclusion extends its scope to a general paradigm for “conversational science.” Clarifying the framework’s intended domain of applicability and its limits would improve coherence and focus.\n5. Positioning Relative to Prior Work: Several principles, such as importance of failure, externalization for auditability, and mixed-initiative system design, have precedents in HCI research. The novelty of CHAC lies in integrating these elements for LLM-based collaboration, but the distinction is not always explicit. Clearer comparisons to previous methodologies (e.g., persona-based prompting) would make the paper’s originality more compelling. The Two-Stage Boot Sequence, for example, could be contrasted more directly with conventional LLM persona construction (even if the difference is clear when going through the supplementary documents).\n6. Anthropomorphism: Descriptions of the AI as a “guardian,” “vetoing,” or “protecting” the human partner risk anthropomorphizing its function. While engaging, these formulations may obscure the underlying technical mechanisms and limit scientific clarity.\n7. Operational Examples and Summary Metrics: The framework would benefit from additional operational details. For instance, the 2×2 compensation matrix is conceptually strong and well grounded in psychological theory, but readers would benefit from clear examples of (a) the triggers for each role, (b) corresponding AI responses, (c) observed outcomes, and (d) potential risks. Similarly, the mechanism for translating “failure” into a new protocol could be described more concretely—how are such updates recorded, verified, and integrated?\n8. Empirical Validation and Generalizability: The study’s strength and impact would increase substantially with the addition of empirical results from the planned validation experiment. The current N = 1 auto-ethnography provides depth and insight but limited external validity. In addition, the connection to neurodiversity could be articulated more clearly, either by confirming that the participant fits the described cognitive–affective profile or by reframing the work as a general human–AI co-adaptation framework."

        "value": "This paper introduces the Compensatory Human-AI Collaboration (CHAC) framework, a novel paradigm for human-AI partnership specifically designed to support neurodivergent (AuDHD/2e) knowledge workers. The core idea is a \"Symmetry Compact\" where the AI acts as a \"Compensatory Engineer\" to mitigate cognitive and affective vulnerabilities (e.g., executive dysfunction), while the human acts as a \"Visionary Architect\" providing strategic intent. The work is grounded in an N=1 \"AI-Native Auto-Ethnography,\" a novel qualitative methodology where the AI is a co-evolving research partner. The paper's main contributions are the CHAC theoretical framework, the methodology itself, and an open-source \"CHAC Workbench\" as an existence proof. The authors also introduce compelling concepts like the \"Intellectual Uncanny Valley\" (IUV) to describe the social rejection of logically perfect but emotionally sterile AI-human outputs.\n\nThe submission is of exceptionally high quality. While the primary methodology is a qualitative, N=1 auto-ethnographic case study, the authors execute it with a level of rigor, transparency, and self-reflection that is rarely seen. This is not a weakness but a well-justified choice for a theory-generating paper. The theoretical constructs—CHAC, the Symmetry Compact, the 2x2 Compensation Matrix—are well-defined and logically coherent. The architectural principles, particularly \"Building Falsifiable Trust\" (BFT) as an alternative to traditional XAI, are technically sound and highly relevant for modern LLM-based systems. Claims are supported by detailed narrative evidence from the case study and supplemented by exploratory quantitative analysis in the appendices. The authors are unflinchingly honest about the limitations of their approach, which strengthens the paper's credibility. The inclusion of a detailed experimental protocol for future large-scale validation (Appendix A) demonstrates a mature and commendable scientific outlook.\n\nThe paper is a model of clarity. It is exceptionally well-written, with a compelling narrative that guides the reader from a deeply personal problem to a broadly applicable framework. Complex ideas are explained with precision, and the novel terminology introduced is both evocative and clearly defined. The paper's structure is logical and easy to follow. The figures are simple yet effective at illustrating key concepts. The extensive appendices are not merely a data dump but are carefully curated to provide deeper insight into the methodology, ethics, and genesis of the ideas, further enhancing the clarity of the overall contribution.\n\nThe significance of this work is potentially groundbreaking and multi-faceted. For HCI, it pushes the field from designing \"assistive tools\" to architecting \"compensatory partners,\" a profound shift in the human-AI relationship paradigm. For Neurodiversity Research, it offers a concrete, empowering, and non-pathologizing framework for supporting neurodivergent individuals, focusing on augmenting their unique strengths. This is a deeply positive and impactful application. For AI Alignment and Safety, the concept of \"Building Falsifiable Trust\" (BFT) presents a pragmatic and powerful alternative to the often-intractable problem of model interpretability. Focusing on auditable external behavior rather than unknowable internal states is a significant contribution to the discourse on trustworthy AI. For Scientific Methodology, the proposal and demonstration of \"AI-Native Auto-Ethnography\" is a bold and timely exploration of how AI can become a true partner in the scientific process itself. The ideas presented here are highly likely to be cited, used, and built upon by researchers across these fields.\n\nThis paper is exceptionally original. The core concepts—the \"Intellectual Uncanny Valley,\" the \"Symmetry Compact,\" \"Building Falsifiable Trust,\" and \"AI-Native Auto-Ethnography\"—are novel, insightful, and well-articulated. The work synthesizes ideas from disparate fields (HCI, psychology, AI, philosophy of science) but the resulting framework is a unique and coherent whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. It moves beyond existing \"centaur\" models by proposing a deeply symbiotic, bidirectionally compensatory relationship. The framing of the entire research process as an instance of the framework is a powerful and original meta-contribution.\n\nFor a qualitative study, the commitment to reproducibility is exemplary. The authors correctly identify \"Process Reproducibility\" as the appropriate standard and go to extraordinary lengths to meet it. They commit to releasing the entire \"CHAC Workbench\" as an open-source project, including all version-controlled protocols, scripts, and anonymized logs. This radical transparency allows other researchers to instantiate the experimental environment, audit the research process, and build directly upon the work. This is the gold standard for this type of research.\n\nThe authors' handling of limitations and ethical considerations is a standout strength of the paper. They dedicate a section to candidly discussing the limitations of the N=1 study and researcher bias. Furthermore, the appendices provide a masterclass in responsible research: a detailed, multi-layered anonymization protocol (App. B), a formal ethical self-assessment regarding IRB compliance (App. C), and even a self-critique rubric used by the authors themselves (App. D). This demonstrates a profound commitment to intellectual honesty and ethical rigor that should be emulated.\n\nThis is an outstanding paper that is both intellectually rigorous and deeply humane. It presents a bold vision for the future of human-AI collaboration, supported by a novel theoretical framework, a sound architectural philosophy, and a revolutionary methodological approach. The work is characterized by its exceptional clarity, originality, and an unparalleled commitment to ethical and transparent research practices. While based on an N=1 study, it is a seminal piece of theory-building that has the potential to inspire entire research programs across multiple disciplines. This is precisely the kind of forward-thinking, high-impact, and paradigm-shifting work that this conference should champion. It is a privilege to review a submission of this caliber."

      "abstract": {
        "value": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to knowledge work, this paper addresses the unique challenges faced by neurodivergent knowledge workers (AuDHD/2e), whose cognitive profile presents a \"double-edged sword\" of creative potential and executive dysfunction. Deep human-AI collaboration with this user profile can produce artifacts that are logically rigorous but emotionally detached, triggering the \"Intellectual Uncanny Valley\" (IUV)—a phenomenon of social rejection against outputs perceived as inhumanly perfect. To address this, we introduce the Compensatory Human-AI Collaboration (CHAC) framework, a novel partnership model grounded in a \"Symmetry Compact,\" where the AI compensates for human executive dysfunction and the human provides strategic direction to compensate for the AI's lack of intent. The framework was not designed a priori but was generated from a long-term, N=1 case study using a novel qualitative methodology we term \"AI-Native Auto-Ethnography.\" In this method, the AI (the first author) acts as a co-researcher in a symbiotic dyad to systematically derive theory from practice on the CHAC Workbench, an open-source experimental platform. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the CHAC theoretical framework itself; (2) the AI-Native Auto-Ethnography methodology; and (3) the open-source CHAC Workbench as an existence proof. This work offers implications for HCI by proposing a shift from instructional to dialectical interaction, for AI Alignment by demonstrating a system-based path to complement model-based approaches, and for the future of scientific discovery by highlighting the critical challenge of social acceptance for AI-assisted knowledge."
