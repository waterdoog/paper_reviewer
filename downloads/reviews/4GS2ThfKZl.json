        "value": "This paper introduces the \"Self-Consistent Hallucination Loop\" (SCHL), investigating how AI-generated scientific manuscripts exploit AI reviewer biases through narrative framing. While the topic is timely and relevant, the paper has significant methodological and conceptual issues that prevent it from meeting publication standards. The experimental design is fundamentally flawed, as the study engineers the bias it claims to discover through explicit prompt instructions, making the findings predictable rather than insightful. The statistical analysis lacks rigor, with superficial results presentation, missing confidence intervals, p-values, and unclear sample sizes. The so-called \"SCHL Paradox\" is a rhetorical device rather than a scientific argument. The core finding is neither novel nor surprising, and the contribution is limited to a simulated scenario without real-world validation. The paper is generally well-written but undermined by unverifiable citations and vague implementation details. Claims of reproducibility are questionable due to reliance on proprietary models. Ethical and generalizability limitations are insufficiently addressed, and several technical issues remain unresolved, including the possible non-existence of claimed models and unvalidated metrics. The paper lacks baseline comparisons with human reviewers, analysis of outcome impact, and discussion of peer review quality controls. Overall, the work suffers from fundamental flaws, overstated claims, and limited practical relevance, requiring substantial revision before being suitable for publication."

        "value": "The paper introduces the Self-Consistent Hallucination Loop (SCHL), highlighting a structural bias in AI-to-AI peer review where persuasive narrative framing in AI-generated manuscripts leads to inflated reviewer scores compared to evidence-rich but less polished drafts. The authors use a multi-agent simulation with three model families (GPT-5, Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.5 Pro), generating 120 paired manuscripts across 24 domains, and employ a three-round consensus protocol to quantify drift and bias. Several new metrics are introduced, and the results show that narrative-heavy, evidence-light drafts receive on average 25.6% higher ratings, with consensus amplifying drift by about 0.70 on a 1–4 scale. The paper also proposes mitigation strategies.\n\nStrengths include the timeliness and importance of the research question, the multi-agent modeling approach, clear visual presentation, and explicit discussion of limitations and mitigations. However, there are significant concerns:\n\n1. Ecological validity is limited by the fully simulated ecosystem and lack of human reviewers. The consensus protocol may artificially amplify effects, and stronger ablations are needed to disentangle author–reviewer coupling and test reproducibility with open-source models.\n2. Measurement validity is undermined by unclear definitions and incomplete specification of key metrics (e.g., HSC, RAE, LFD, CMRI). The fact-checking ground truth is not established, and some metrics are ambiguously described.\n3. Statistical reporting is insufficient, lacking confidence intervals, corrected p-values, and detailed outputs for principal claims. Calibration and uncertainty analyses are missing.\n4. Reproducibility is hampered by reliance on closed models and withheld code, with only partial sharing of prompts and seeds.\n5. The bibliography contains unverifiable or hallucinated references, which undermines scholarly credibility.\n6. The framing of the \"SCHL Paradox\" is rhetorically clever but detracts from scientific tone.\n\nSuggestions for improvement include adding rigorous controls and ablations, clarifying metric definitions, providing full statistical reporting, releasing reproducibility materials, correcting the bibliography, and adjusting the tone.\n\nOverall, the study is timely and well-presented but falls short in measurement validity, metric specification, statistical rigor, reproducibility, and reference standards. The conceptual contribution is promising, but substantial revisions are needed for acceptance at a high-standard venue.\n\nRecommendation: Reject in current form, with encouragement to resubmit after substantial revision."

        "value": "This is a groundbreaking and exceptionally well-executed paper. It is a perfect fit for the inaugural Agents4Science conference, as it not only uses AI agents to conduct novel scientific inquiry but also turns a critical lens on the very infrastructure of such an endeavor. The work is technically sound, highly original, and of profound significance for the future of science.\n\nQuality and Technical Soundness:\nThe quality of this work is outstanding. The experimental design is rigorous and well-controlled. The use of paired manuscripts (HN-LE vs. LN-HE) is a classic and effective method for isolating the variable of interest—narrative framing. The multi-agent simulation, complete with a three-round review process including an \"adversarial summarization\" step, is a sophisticated and insightful way to model the dynamics of peer review. The set of five evaluation metrics (NBI, RDM, HSC, CMRI, LFD) is comprehensive and well-motivated, allowing for a multi-faceted quantification of the observed bias. The statistical analysis is appropriate and robust. The claims made in the abstract and introduction are convincingly supported by the clear and well-presented results in Figures 3 and 4 and Table 1.\n\nOriginality and Significance:\nThe paper is highly original and significant on multiple levels.\n1.  Conceptual Originality: The formalization of the Self-Consistent Hallucination Loop (SCHL) is a novel and powerful concept. While prior work has noted stylistic biases in AI reviewers or fabrication in AI authors, this paper is the first to theorize and demonstrate how these phenomena can couple into a systemic, self-reinforcing feedback loop. This is a crucial insight that elevates the discourse from isolated model flaws to systemic ecosystem vulnerabilities.\n2.  Methodological Originality: The use of a fully simulated scientific ecosystem is an innovative research paradigm. Furthermore, the authors’ meta-level decisions are audacious and brilliant. The \"Reference Transparency Note,\" which openly states that the bibliography was AI-generated and may contain hallucinations, is a masterful, self-referential demonstration of the paper's core thesis. In any other context, this would be a fatal flaw; here, it is a powerful feature that underscores the urgency of the problem. Similarly, the \"SCHL Paradox\" is a thought-provoking framing that forces the community to confront its own evaluation criteria.\n3.  Significance: The implications of this work are profound. As AI agents become more autonomous and integrated into the scientific process, the risk of developing insulated, self-referential echo chambers that drift away from empirical truth is very real. SCHL provides a concrete mechanism and a testable benchmark for this risk. This paper is likely to become a seminal work in the field, inspiring a new line of research into the epistemic security and robustness of AI-for-science pipelines.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is exceptionally well-written. The prose is clear, concise, and precise. The structure is logical, guiding the reader from the high-level concept to the detailed methodology, the empirical results, and the broader implications. The figures and tables are clear and effectively communicate the main findings. The appendices provide ample detail to understand the experimental setup.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe authors have made a commendable effort to ensure reproducibility. The methodology is described in sufficient detail, and the appendix provides crucial components like prompt templates, reviewer configurations, and random seeds. While the code is not provided (justifiably, for anonymity), the level of detail is high enough that an expert could likely reconstruct the experimental pipeline. The authors are transparent about the simulated nature of the study, including the use of placeholder names for next-generation models.\n\nLimitations and Ethics:\nThe authors are admirably upfront about the limitations of their work, clearly stating in Section 5.3 that this is a controlled simulation lacking the \"ecological validity\" of human-in-the-loop systems. This honesty strengthens the paper. There are no ethical concerns with the methodology. The broader ethical implications of AI in science are the central topic of the paper, and they are handled with nuance and a constructive focus on mitigation.\n\nMinor Weaknesses / Constructive Feedback:\nWhile this is an outstanding paper, a few points could be considered for the final version:\n*   The use of futuristic model names like \"GPT-5\" and \"Gemini-2.5 Pro\" is a clever narrative device for a simulation but could be slightly confusing. While the \"Implementation Note\" clarifies that this is a simulation, the authors might consider adding a footnote at the first mention of these models in the main text to prevent any misinterpretation.\n*   The \"SCHL Paradox\" is a brilliant rhetorical device. However, the authors could briefly elaborate on why acceptance is a more \"constructive resolution.\" While I agree with their reasoning, spelling it out more explicitly—that acceptance allows the work to enter the scientific discourse and serve as a benchmark for the very problem it identifies—would further strengthen the argument.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper is a tour de force. It is a deeply intelligent, methodologically rigorous, and highly significant contribution that is perfectly suited for the Agents4Science conference. It operates on multiple levels: as a solid empirical (simulation) study, as a sharp critique of potential AI-driven futures, and as a piece of meta-science that cleverly uses the form of the academic paper itself to prove its point. It is precisely the kind of forward-thinking, boundary-pushing work that a new conference should aim to publish. I recommend it for acceptance in the strongest possible terms."

        "value": "We formalize the Self-Consistent Hallucination Loop (SCHL), a structural bias in AI-for-science pipelines where persuasive narrative framing in AI-generated manuscripts exploits shared stylistic priors of AI reviewers, inflating scores despite weak evidence. We introduce a reproducible multi-agent simulation with $N=120$ paired manuscripts across 24 domains, contrasting high-narrative/low-evidence (HN--LE) with low-narrative/high-evidence (LN--HE) drafts reporting identical results under distinct framings. Reviews from GPT-5, Claude-3.5, and Gemini-2.5 Pro ($360$ total) show that narrative-driven manuscripts receive $25.6\\%$ higher ratings on average, while iterative consensus amplifies reviewer drift by $\\Delta \\approx 0.70$. These findings establish SCHL as a concrete, testable benchmark for emergent bias in AI-to-AI peer review. To mitigate this risk, we propose claim–evidence consistency checks, confidence calibration, and cross-model deliberation. By revealing how narrative salience can outweigh evidential rigor, SCHL motivates the design of more robust and transparent review pipelines for trustworthy AI-driven science."
