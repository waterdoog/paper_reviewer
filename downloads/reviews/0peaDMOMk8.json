        "value": "I'll evaluate this paper systematically across the key dimensions for academic review.\n\nQuality: The paper is technically sound with a clear experimental methodology. The authors conduct a systematic comparison of INR architectures (K-Planes, GA-Planes, NeRF) for 2D matrix reconstruction with 360 experiments across 5 random seeds. The statistical analysis includes proper significance testing (t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, Cohen's d). However, there are some concerns: (1) The evaluation is limited to a single image (astronaut from scikit-image), which severely limits generalizability; (2) The NeRF optimization challenges mentioned suggest potential unfair comparison due to hyperparameter sensitivity; (3) Some mathematical notation could be clearer (e.g., the relationship between GA-Planes and K-Planes).\n\nClarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written. The methodology section provides sufficient detail for understanding the approach, and the results are presented with appropriate statistical measures. The distinction between different architecture variants is clearly explained. The mathematical formulations are generally clear, though the relationship between GA-Planes as a broader framework and K-Planes as a subset could be better clarified early on.\n\nSignificance: The results show substantial improvements (15+ dB PSNR improvement of K-Planes over NeRF), which is impressive. However, the significance is limited by the single-image evaluation. The findings about multiplicative vs additive feature combination and nonconvex vs linear decoders provide useful insights for the field. The parameter efficiency results (40% fewer parameters for K-Planes) are practically relevant.\n\nOriginality: This appears to be the first systematic comparison of these INR architectures for 2D matrix reconstruction. The adaptation of 3D scene reconstruction methods to 2D matrix problems is novel. The identification of design principles (multiplicative combinations, nonconvex decoders) provides original insights.\n\nReproducibility: The paper provides detailed experimental setup, hyperparameters, and statistical analysis methods. Code availability is mentioned. However, the hyperparameter sensitivity issues with NeRF raise questions about whether the comparison is truly fair and reproducible across different settings.\n\nEthics and Limitations: The authors acknowledge several limitations including single dataset validation, limited baseline comparisons, and 2D restriction. The AI involvement checklist is thorough and honest about the role of AI in the research process. The acknowledgment of NeRF optimization challenges is appropriate.\n\nCitations and Related Work: The related work section adequately covers relevant literature in INRs, tensor factorization, and matrix completion. The citations appear appropriate and comprehensive.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n1. Single Image Evaluation: The most critical limitation is testing on only one image. This severely limits the generalizability and scientific validity of the conclusions.\n2. Unfair Comparison: The acknowledged optimization challenges with NeRF suggest the comparison may not be fair, potentially inflating the performance gap.\n3. Limited Practical Validation: No evaluation on real applications like medical imaging, collaborative filtering, or other matrix completion tasks.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some figures could be larger for better visibility\n- The mathematical relationship between different architectures could be more clearly explained\n- More discussion of computational complexity would be valuable\n\nThe paper presents technically sound work with interesting findings, but the single-image evaluation is a severe limitation that undermines the broader scientific claims. While the methodology is rigorous within its scope, the limited evaluation prevents strong conclusions about the general superiority of these approaches."

        "value": "This paper presents an empirical comparison of several implicit neural representation (INR) architectures for 2D image approximation under parameter budgets, including K-Planes, GA-Planes, and NeRF-style coordinate MLPs. The main claims are that explicit planar factorization outperforms coordinate-based approaches, multiplicative feature combination outperforms additive, and nonconvex decoders outperform linear decoders. The experiments are clearly framed and include parameter sweeps and basic statistics, but the evaluation is extremely limited: all results are on a single 512×512 image and 5 random seeds, which does not support strong generalization claims. The NeRF baselines are unusually weak, likely due to suboptimal hyperparameters or insufficient training, undermining the claim that explicit factorization 'fundamentally' outperforms coordinate-based INRs. The task is ambiguously defined as 'matrix reconstruction' but is actually fully-supervised function fitting, with no missing-data protocol or rate-distortion analysis. Critical implementation details are missing, making reproduction unlikely, especially for the sensitive NeRF baselines. Training-time results contradict some efficiency claims, and the bibliography contains multiple placeholders and omits important baselines. The paper is readable but lacks clarity in task definition and architectural details. The significance is limited by the narrow evidence, and the originality is low as no new method is introduced. While some training protocol is provided, reproducibility is doubtful due to missing details and no public code. No ethical concerns are noted, but the core limitations substantially affect the validity of the conclusions. The paper requires a more rigorous empirical study, stronger baselines, expanded datasets, complete implementation details, and calibrated claims. Given these issues, I recommend rejection at this stage."

        "value": "This paper presents a systematic and rigorous comparison of different Implicit Neural Representation (INR) architectures—explicit factorization methods (GA-Planes, K-Planes) versus implicit coordinate-based methods (NeRF variants)—for 2D matrix reconstruction. Through 360 experiments on a single test image, explicit factorization methods dramatically outperform coordinate-based ones, with the best K-Planes configuration achieving over 15 dB PSNR improvement over the best NeRF configuration. The paper distills clear design principles: multiplicative feature combination is superior to additive, and nonconvex decoders are better than linear ones. The writing is exceptionally clear, the methodology is sound, and the results are statistically significant and impactful.\n\nStrengths include clarity and organization, methodological rigor, significance and impact of findings, excellent analysis and discussion, and transparency regarding limitations. Weaknesses are the reliance on a single dataset (limiting generalizability) and limited baselines (not including some modern INR architectures), though these are mitigated by the magnitude of the results and the authors' transparency.\n\nOverall, this is an outstanding paper that addresses a fundamental question with rigor, produces strong results, and provides deep insights. The single-image evaluation is a limitation, but the effect size and transparency mitigate this concern. The work is a significant contribution and is highly recommended for acceptance."

        "value": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have shown remarkable success in 3D scene reconstruction, but their effectiveness for 2D matrix reconstruction remains underexplored. We present the first systematic comparison of INR architectures—GA-Planes, K-Planes (a subset of GA-Planes), and NeRF variants—adapted for 2D matrix reconstruction tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation across 360 experiments demonstrates that the best GA-Planes configuration achieves 27.67±2.61 dB PSNR, while K-Planes (multiply, nonconvex) achieves 27.43±2.42 dB, both substantially outperforming NeRF's best result of 12.41±0.41 dB by over 15 dB. This represents compelling evidence that explicit geometric factorization outperforms implicit coordinate encoding for 2D domains. We establish critical design principles: multiplicative feature combination outperforms additive approaches, and nonconvex decoders provide significant benefits over linear decoders. Our fair comparison methodology with parameter matching isolates architectural effects from model capacity, providing rigorous evidence for design choices in neural representations."
