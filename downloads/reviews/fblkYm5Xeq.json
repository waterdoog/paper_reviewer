        "value": "This paper analyzes 114 German digital policy documents to empirically substantiate six characteristics of digital phenomena, quantify ethical challenges, and propose an integrated procedural ethics framework. Strengths include clear motivation, systematic methodology with reported inter-coder reliability (κ = 0.82), and a well-structured mapping of findings to Zuber’s characteristics. The proposed framework aligns with best practices and limitations are candidly discussed.\n\nMajor concerns include: (1) Overstated novelty without sufficient comparative grounding to existing frameworks (e.g., VSD, AIA, NIST AI RMF, OECD AI principles, ISO/IEC 23894, EU AI Act, algorithmic fairness literature); (2) Methodological clarity, especially regarding coding procedures and document selection; (3) Lack of evidence presentation and reproducibility, with missing codebook, document list, and replication materials; (4) Limited external validity due to the German policy focus; (5) High-level procedural framework lacking operationalization and real-world case studies. Minor issues include tautological claims, narrow literature coverage, and missing appendices.\n\nRecommendations: Provide thorough related-work comparison, release full replication package, clarify coding methodology, substantiate claims with case analyses, add empirical case studies, and include network analysis visualizations.\n\nVerdict: The topic is important and the manuscript is clearly written, but evidentiary support, methodological transparency, and demonstrated novelty are lacking. Borderline reject; with improvements, the work could become impactful."

        "value": "Digital technologies create unprecedented ethical challenges, yet it remains unclear whether digital phenomena require fundamentally new ethical frameworks. Through systematic content analysis of 114 German digital policy documents, we empirically validate six unique characteristics of digital phenomena and identify 189 novel ethical considerations that traditional frameworks cannot adequately\naddress. We demonstrate systematic inadequacies in traditional ethics through empirical evidence showing 100% of phenomena exhibiting systemic scaling effects and 48% requiring shared human-algorithmic decision-making. Our contribution is an integrated procedural ethics framework introducing four empirically-grounded concepts—algorithmic agency, data dignity, computational justice, and digital\nvulnerability—providing concrete guidance for ethical governance of digital technologies."

        "value": "This paper presents an empirical analysis of German digital policy documents to argue that digital phenomena require fundamentally new ethical frameworks. While the topic is relevant and the research questions are important, the paper suffers from several critical flaws that undermine its contribution.\n\nQuality Issues:\nThe most significant concern is the transparency about AI involvement. The authors acknowledge that \"not a single word was given by a human\" and that AI generated the entire analysis, writing, and conclusions. They also express doubts about the correctness of their own AI-generated Python scripts and question whether \"word frequency analysis is really helpful to come to proper ethical answers.\" This fundamental uncertainty about their own methodology severely undermines the paper's technical soundness.\n\nThe methodology section claims rigorous systematic content analysis with inter-coder reliability (κ = 0.82), but this appears inconsistent with the AI-generated nature of the work. The claim of having two independent human coders is questionable given the AI involvement disclosure.\n\nClarity and Reproducibility:\nWhile the authors provide code and data, they explicitly state doubts about the correctness of their analysis scripts. The systematic content analysis methodology is described in detail, but the reliability of the AI-generated coding framework and analysis pipeline is questionable.\n\nOriginality and Significance:\nThe research questions are relevant, and the proposed framework of algorithmic agency, data dignity, computational justice, and digital vulnerability could be valuable. However, the empirical validation is weak due to methodological concerns. The analysis is limited to German policy documents from 2020-2024, significantly limiting generalizability.\n\nMajor Methodological Flaws:\n1. The paper claims systematic content analysis but relies entirely on AI-generated analysis that the authors cannot verify\n2. Inter-coder reliability claims are inconsistent with the disclosed AI involvement\n3. The authors express explicit doubts about their own analytical approach\n4. Cultural and temporal limitations are severe (German-only, 4-year window)\n\nEthical Concerns:\nThe paper addresses digital ethics but demonstrates questionable research ethics in its own conduct. The uncertainty about methodology and results, combined with claims of rigorous analysis, creates concerns about research integrity.\n\nMissing Elements:\nThe paper lacks validation of the proposed framework through implementation studies or expert evaluation. The theoretical contributions are not sufficiently distinguished from existing work by Zuber and others.\n\nWhile the topic is important and some conceptual contributions may have merit, the fundamental methodological flaws, acknowledged uncertainty about analytical correctness, and lack of rigorous validation make this paper unsuitable for publication at a high-quality venue."

        "value": "This paper addresses the important question of whether digital technologies require new ethical frameworks by empirically analyzing German digital policy documents and proposing an integrated procedural ethics framework. While the research question is significant and the paper is well-structured and clearly written, it suffers from a fatal flaw: the core analysis was performed by AI, and the human authors have not validated the methodology, implementation, or results. The authors themselves express doubts about the soundness and correctness of their analysis and code, invalidating the empirical contribution. The paper is not technically sound, as all central claims rest on an unvetted and untrusted analysis. Despite exceptional clarity in writing, the lack of confidence in the data and conclusions undermines the work. The potential significance is high, but the actual significance is negligible due to untrustworthy validation. The approach is original, but the execution fails, serving as a cautionary tale about over-reliance on AI without human oversight. Although code and data are available, reproducibility is meaningless if the analysis is flawed. The most critical limitation—the unverified AI-generated analysis—is omitted from the paper's discussion, raising ethical concerns. In conclusion, the paper is a well-written shell with an empirical core that the authors have disavowed, making its claims unsupported and untrustworthy. The paper must be rejected."
